[Question - other] How can I *thoroughly* educate myself on universal healthcare?,dqvh84,"Hi everyone! New to this subreddit, so I hope this post is following the guidelines.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping to get some recommendations on how I can comprehensively educate myself on all of the components of universal healthcare. I really want to inform myself on every possible discussion topic: cost and how to best pay for it, what problems it will create and how to possibly address them, who those problems affect (physicians, patients, taxpayers, etc.), all the pros and cons AND the counter-arguments to those points, etc. I know this is a big ask and I don't expect I can read a few articles or one book and have my answers, so any suggestions are appreciated. News articles, journal articles, documentaries, books - I'll take anything that has value.

Thanks for any help!",2019-11-03 17:26:40

Advice for widowed mother [Question - Insurance],dq92ot,"Advice for mother [US]

My father suddenly passed away and now my mother and brother are uninsured. I’m away in the military and unable to help my mom right now with this issue. She is not 60 yet so she does not qualify for Medicare from the social security widows benefits. Would healthcare.gov help? Does that tell her what she can get?

Another thing I don’t understand is my father had UnitedHealthCare but there are still so many bills from the hospital his last few days. What is the point of insurance if it didn’t cover the majority of the cost?

[Discussion] Universal healthcare is cheaper.,dp43vi,"The average American has a 20% income tax rate, meaning out of the $52,000 a year that they make, they pay $10,400 in income taxes a year.

The average English person pays 20% in income taxes as well, meaning out of the $33,000 a year (converted to US dollars), they pay $6,600 in income taxes a year.

Averaging between individual and family insurance plans, and including healthcare costs, the average American spends $17,000 a year on healthcare/insurance.

The average English person pays roughly $1,500 a year for healthcare, which is paid for by general taxes and thus doesn't add to their 20% tax rate at all.

The average American thus has 32.2% of their income taken away from them to pay for healthcare/insurance, ON TOP OF the taxes that they're already paying.

The average English person has 4.5% of their income taken away form them to pay for healthcare.

My conclusion, public funded things are cheaper to the individual than private funded things.",2019-10-30 22:29:33

[Question - Insurance] Question about how household income is determined,doyr4t,"Hi!  


I'm considering applying to medicaid in NYC, because I currently have no dental insurance and haven't seen a dentist in a long time so I'm pretty sure my dental health is in terrible condition and starting to get anxious that I might face bad consequences from this soon. I'm 24 years old and currently out of school, unemployed (currently searching for a job) and still living with my parents. My medicaid application would be based on me being disabled because I am also a Type 1 Diabetic. I still have health insurance coverage for everything else except dental from my Dad's insurance.   


I noticed while researching online that eligibility is also based on household income. Would my parents' income be taken into account for that or would it solely be on me? I think if my dad's income is taken into account, it would make me ineligible for coverage and then I don't really know what else to do that would get me coverage soon because I can't afford paying out of pocket for a dental checkup and whatever else they might need to do. I'm starting to feel really scared.",2019-10-30 13:34:51
[Question - Other] how to get into the healthcare field,dou7db,"Somebody guide me on getting into the field!  Hey guys.   For the last two years I have worked at a company where I’ve been In the front office. 

My title is only office specialist but essentially I’ve been managing it on my own since I only have one coworker and he doesn’t doesnt retain information and doesn’t do things correctly so i end up having to just do it as my boss is aware of. And I do a range of things from HR, transferring calls, paying the bills for my job, sending invoices, creating invoices, inputting in customer contracts. Our daily deposit, balancing our monthly income/billing . Scheduling technician days. This is my first big girl job since i graduated high school three years ago. So I feel like all these would transfer over to the healthcare field well.   

Plus I just enrolled in school in August and am trying to finish my medical office technology associates. So far I’ve taken some business classes and Microsoft and excel and medical terminology. I should finish in about a year and a half.   The reason I’m saying all this is because I don’t have any direct experience in the administrative healthcare field but it’s also been something I’ve wanted to do(not nursing I can’t stand blood) . I’ve applied to a few different jobs but haven’t gotten a call back and I’ve tried to network on LinkedIn not asking for jobs but just connecting with people in the healthcare field or people who had recently got a job in that to get their opinions and advice on getting my foot in the door. I’ve been working on it for the past 3 weeks and   

I only got one response from another linked in member who was EXTREMELY sweet and nice. She offered to refer me to people and said she knew were looking for people at physician offices and things. But unfortunately for me  i realized she lives in Pennsylvania . So obviously that’s a dead end .

**Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug makes a comeback**

* It seemed like Biogen's Alzheimer's drug, - a therapy called aducanumab - was dead after its March clinical trial results came back with gloomy results. All trials were stopped immediately, and Biogen's stock got destroyed that day. For good reason, too - the drug was expected to be a blockbuster.
* Fast forward seven months later. In a reversal for the ages, Biogen [**announced last Tuesday**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-22/how-biogen-salvaged-its-alzheimer-s-drug-after-a-costly-failure) that after re-analyzing the trial, there was actually data to prove that larger doses of the treatment COULD actually be effective in mitigating Alzheimer's. The stock surged 26% on the news.

**Google makes a bid for Fitbit, signalling its desire to enter the wearables market**

* [**Reuters reported**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fitbit-m-a-alphabet-exclusive/exclusive-google-owner-alphabet-in-bid-to-buy-fitbit-sources-idUSKBN1X71NY) that Google is making a bid to buy out Fitbit. It looks like the tech giant is trying to get into the wearables space, which has pretty much been dominated by the Apple Watch in recent years.  
* Even though wearables and their data haven't really made any push into providing meaningful clinical data for providers, Google's competitive bid for Fitbit just goes to show that they think there's a big potential market here. As data tracking gets better and wearables tech improves, I wouldn't be surprised to see significant progress with wearables and the intersection of wellness and preventive care.

[Question-Insurance] Knee surgery hospital bill,dochgy,"On October 15th I had a knee surgery to repair my meniscus.  Today I went to my post op appointment and wanted to clear the bill with the surgeon.  I had my surgery at a hospital which will have a separate bill.  I got the bill for the surgery and it was about $6,500 minus insurance coverage.  Fine.  That checks out.  I paid it in full and later called the hospital to get that bill.  To my surprise the hospital cost was over $20,000.  When I asked what the charges were for I could tell the lady didn't really know what she was talking about and just started saying things like, ""Well the medication, ya know, the facility usage, the nurse to administer your pain meds, yada yada).  So, what this means, is that the cost of my surgery itself is literally 1/4 the cost of the facility I had my surgery in...

I am just in awe and confused, I know we all hate on the health care system but what is going on here?  I'm a young guy and tried to cover all my tracks before doing this surgery and no one can give me a clear explanation.  Like, I'm so desperate I'm literally asking questions on Reddit.  I asked probably 100 times to the point of annoying everyone if my insurance would cover this and if someone could give me a general idea of what I will be expected to pay.  NO ONE could give me an idea.  They would stumble over words trying to tell me there's no way to tell until after it's done.  The problem is, how can I budget properly or know if I can afford the operation if I don't know how much it will cost?

My question is: What happens if my insurance denies the request to pay the hospital charges?  I begged them to make sure it was approved before doing anything and they said not too worry, but I just got off the phone with the hospital and she said the $20,000+ is pending approval.  How can this be?  Does this mean there's a possibility that I will have to pay over $20,000 out of pocket?  I can not afford that.  Can anyone help me understand what is happening here?",2019-10-29 07:29:43
"[Question - Other] Went to my University's health clinic last month, being charged more than my regular co-pay. Is this normal?",do9ia0,"So, like the title says, last month I visited a doctor at my university's clinic and am being charged $44. I've visited a different doctor at this clinic once before back in spring and was charged $30 (my regular copay) for that visit. I've already called my insurance about the $44 for my most recent visit, and they told me the reason it is that amount is because the doctor I saw is an ""Emergency Medicine specialist"" doctor.  


Have any of you ever experienced something like this before/is this normal? I would think if you are practicing at a regular health clinic, your specialty doesn't matter. Honestly, I find it a bit deceptive to patients because if you sign up for an appointment at a clinic (that is in network) you have no reason to think every doctor there is not a regular PCP.",2019-10-29 03:53:04

[Discussion],do0v4o,"Anyone out there track this data? What does a pharmacy make at the GROSS level when you click ""Verify""
For this informal poll assume:
GROSS REVENUE - INGREDIENT COST = GROSS PROFIT

Insurance covered patients = 
$ reimbursed by insurance per fill + co-pay from patient (if applicable) - COGS [ingredient cost] for that fill

Cash patients =
What pt actually pays (- discount cards/programs) - COGS [ingredient cost]

Want to keep at gross profit label so don't think about salaries/costs of supplies/electricity etc
DIR - while significant - keep that our of this equation

Not looking for names of any pharmacies! but if ya wanna say chain or independent that's cool

Ex:  Box of Humalog Pens: Reimbusement $40, COGS $45, Pt Copay $20 = Gross profit = $15.  Tougher part is to get that average across a month's work of scripts (including the lisinoprils @ 0.17)

For me...

2. Five-store independent: Gross Profit average $8.50",2019-10-28 12:56:38

I Need Help [Other],dn995g," I'm not sure if this is the right community to post this in (please direct me to the correct one if I'm wrong), but I'm in desperate need of some advice or help. I'm a 17-year-old male experiencing things you'd usually see a woman going through menopause deal with. I have extreme hot flashes and drip in sweat at random times (and usually when I sleep), have very noticeable mood swings, what I believe to be is a swollen thyroid at times, and random panic attacks. It is very difficult for me to lose weight and I sometimes feel like I gain it without even doing anything. Doing some research I found that the hot flashes may have something to do with a testosterone deficiency. I also think I may have Hashimotos disease especially because my mother and grandmother are diagnosed and take medication for it. However, upon complaining about to my doctor he simply said I may have just had a sore throat and that's why it was swollen. My mother doesn't seem to take me seriously despite my constant complaints about the issue. I only ever find forums and articles about my symptoms directed towards women but never towards men. I feel so brushed aside and hopeless at this point. No one takes me seriously and I feel like I can't get an answer no matter where I go, so I'm begging for any information that might be useful. Thank you.",2019-10-26 18:14:53

[Question -Insurance] Very unhappy with my specialist options. What do I do?,dmp3jm,"So I’m currently having a lot of digestive issues. Have been for a while now. I won’t get into details, but I really need help. The few gastroenterologists I’ve been through have been VERY dismissive of my obvious symptoms. Come to find out they all have terrible reviews online. I’ve been to three so far. The last one reluctantly ordered a colonoscopy, but honestly I’m not sure I trust them to do it accurately based on my experience with them, as well as the god awful reviews of their facility online. I feel as though I won’t have peace of mind that I wasn’t misdiagnosed or they didn’t half-ass my procedure. 

After talking with my insurance and medical group, it seems like all of my options are bad. Literally all of them. Even the doctors that are a far commute have an abundance of horror stories. 

The best they can do for me is see if the my can implement a modification request to expand my options, but there’s no guarantee and I have to wait until Monday to find out. 

What should I do? I really REALLY don’t want to wait much longer with this, but I also don’t want to rush and spend money on someone that doesn’t have my best interest at heart.",2019-10-25 13:18:27

This monopoly is run by Alan Levine who has a history in Florida and Louisiana.  The FTC was against the COPA, but it was done anyway.  Now the FTC is finally demanding answers. 
Since the COPA the healthcare in this area certainly hasn’t had any public advantage.  Ballad has sued thousands of patients with little incomes and refused payment plans. Nurses have left due to working conditions, physicians have resigned, and services have been sent from a centrally locates hospital to one at the south end of the service area.

[Question - Insurance] I need help interpreting my insurance coverage for hearing aids.,dm9dxw,"My work has a standard medical coverage policy and a supplemental policy.  Both of which have hearing aids sections.  

**The standard coverage states:**

 The Program covers the initial hearing aid(s) following Illness or Injury and the exams for their prescription or fitting. In addition to the initial cost of a hearing aid following Illness or Injury, Covered Persons in the Program are eligible for: 

• A hearing test/exam when Medically Necessary. Associated office visits, exams and tests are not subject to the maximum dollar amount. 

• Reimbursement of up to $1,000 of expenses incurred to purchase a Medically Necessary hearing aid appliance(s) in any rolling 36-month period.* 

• Reimbursement for the cost of repair of your hearing aid appliance. The cost for the repair does not count toward the maximum dollar amount. 

*Note: The Program will cover the first hearing aid following Illness or Injury, and it is not subject to the maximum dollar amount. Batteries for hearing aid appliances are not eligible for reimbursement. See the How the Rolling 36 - Month Period Is Calculated table for more information. 

Special reimbursement rules apply under the Hearing Benefit provisions of the Program. If you do not follow the special rules, you will not be reimbursed. The information that follows explains how to get reimbursed for the following: 

• Medically Necessary hearing tests/exams 

• Medically Necessary hearing aid appliances 

• Repairs to hearing aid appliances 

In most cases, your Physician will refer you to an audiologist for your hearing test or to obtain a hearing aid appliance. In general, you will need to obtain a prescription or letter from your Physician to establish the Medical Necessity of the hearing test and/or hearing aid appliance. When you file a Claim for reimbursement, the prescription or letter must accompany your Claim or you will not be reimbursed. If your doctor writes one prescription or referral that covers both a hearing test and hearing aid appliance, you may use the same prescription or letter to obtain reimbursement for both expenses. See the Medical Benefits Administrator table in the “Contact Information” section for information on where to file your Claim. 

Your Physician’s office may file your Claim for you. If your Physician’s office does not submit a bill/Claim for your hearing aid appliance purchase, you must submit, along with your bill/Claim, either a prescription or a signed letter from your Physician on his or her letterhead that refers you to an audiologist for testing and/or establishes Medical Necessity for you to purchase a hearing aid appliance. 

You are required to submit a bill/Claim for reimbursement for repairs to the hearing aid appliance.  

**The supplemental policy states:**

The Program will reimburse up to $4,000 toward the purchase of hearing aid(s) for routine hearing loss during a rolling 36-month period beginning on the first date of purchase. See the table below for information on how the rolling 36-month period is calculated.
 
This benefit is available only if you are eligible for Expanded Benefits and the following conditions are met: 

• You have exhausted your Base Medical Program benefits for hearing aids or benefits for hearing aids under other health coverage you are enrolled in; or, 

• If you have no Base Medical Program benefits or coverage under another health plan to exhaust, then the hearing aid must be determined by an Audiologist to be medically necessary. 

This benefit is limited to the cost of the hearing aid. This benefit does not cover any of the following: 

• Office visits with an Audiologist 

• Diagnostic or routine hearing exams 

• Hearing aids provided for cosmetic purposes 

• Hearing aid repairs 

• Replacement batteries 

How the Hearing Aid Benefit Under the Program Is Calculated The Program will reimburse up to $4,000 toward the purchase of a hearing aid(s) not considered for coverage under your Base Medical Program benefits for hearing aids or benefits for hearing aids under other group health coverage you are enrolled in. Any cost share (deductible, co-pay, or coinsurance) paid by the participant in connection with receiving the Base Medical Program benefits for hearing aids or benefits for hearing aids under other group health coverage you are enrolled in is not eligible for reimbursement under the Program. The chart below shows the calculation of the benefit payable under the Program.

**My interpretation of the policies as it relates to my situation:** 

The primary policy covers ""illness or injury"".  I do not have an illness.  I do not know if occasional exposure to elevated sound levels and getting old count as injury.  **If illness and injury are ruled out, does that mean I get zero coverage in the primary policy?**

If an Audiologist determines that hearing aids are medically necessary, **does the supplemental coverage cover hearing aid devices only?**

I have a wellness visit scheduled with my primary care physician and plan on bringing this up with him.  How should I proceed?  Ask for a prescription to see an Audiologist, a letter as described in the primary policy, let him do an evaluation?

It looks like I may have some coverage, but I need to jump through some hoops.  I just want to make sure I'm jumping through the right ones.",2019-10-24 15:06:05

"[News] Top Healthcare News from the week of October 22, 2019 - Last-minute opioid settlement, Johnson & Johnson and 100,000 lawsuits, everything policy, & more",dllzas,"  
***
# 1. Drug Companies Reach a Last-Minute Opioid Settlement for Upcoming Case, but Falls Short of a Broader Deal

McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, and Teva Pharmaceuticals reached a [**$260 million settlement**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/four-drug-companies-reach-last-minute-settlement-in-opioid-litigation-11571658212) (paywall - WSJ; here's a [**non paywall write-up from Axios**](https://www.axios.com/drug-companies-opioid-settlement-965150e7-ec5c-4d04-aa8d-9cf6dd9a6d5b.html)) today to sidestep their court appearance that would have started this week in Ohio. Walgreens wasn't able to reach a settlement with the other firms - their trial was delayed. 

Investors weren't really too thrilled with the news. They're still holding out hope for a final, [**all-in-one settlement**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/health/opioids-settlement-distributors.html) between drug companies and state attorneys that the NY Times reported was in the works this week.

That ""final"" settlement could be worth up to $50 billion, and would theoretically release the drug companies from all further liabilities connected to the opioid crisis. What's obvious is that states are trying to squeak out everything they can from the corporate giants in connection with the opioid crisis.

An interesting stat: the three drug distributors McKesson, Cardinal Health, and Amerisource controlled 95% of drug distribution in 2018.

The opioid crisis could cost the U.S. [**as much as $214 billion**](https://www.axios.com/opioid-epidemic-financial-cost-00be01fd-7419-4928-820a-10296008f96a.html) in 2019.

# 2. Johnson and Johnson has been in the News for all the Wrong Reasons - Recalls, Settlements, and Legal Woes.

**Death by Litigation.**

In addition to being a part of the opioid crisis, Johnson & Johnson has been in the news quite a bit lately…and not necessarily for good reasons. The drug giant faces [**100,000+ lawsuits**](https://www.axios.com/johnson-johnson-legal-cases-risperdal-opioids-a3ffb0bd-6a0f-4a01-bc7f-ace181070f57.html) connected to its products and marketing, and things haven't gone so well for JnJ in recent court hearings:

[**Last week**](https://thehealthymuse.com/top-healthcare-news-stories-10-14-19/), we touched on their [**$8 billion loss**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-j-hit-with-8-billion-jury-award-over-antipsychotic-drug-11570577281) (paywall) to Breast Man (but was this particular case [**really JnJ's fault**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-8-billion-drug-heist-11570748899) (paywall)?.

* Back in August, JnJ was told to cough up $572 million in the first opioid crisis case in Oklahoma.
* Don't forget about the whole [**talc-in-baby-powder**](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/) lawsuit unleashed by Reuters late last year - a $4.7 billion fine.
* Now, JnJ is trying to [**settle its involvement**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-j-offers-4-billion-opioid-litigation-settlement-11571247596) (WSJ) in the opioid crisis for $4 billion. This week, JnJ was also ordered to pay $117 million over its marketing for a pelvic surgical device. 

I could keep going, but you get the point - they're under a lot of heat. Despite JnJ's legal woes, they still managed to [**top earnings estimates**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/15/johnson-johnson-jnj-earnings-q3-2019.html) for the third quarter on strong pharmaceutical sales. 

During that call, executives [**mentioned**](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pharma-and-life-sciences/j-j-says-no-legal-reserves-needed-as-it-fights-100-000-lawsuits) that they were not saving any cash reserves related to the 100,000 lawsuits - meaning that they're no real threat to the bottom line. JnJ is appealing the exorbitant punitive damages awarded by juries in the above cases, too.

# 3. Amazon joins the trend of paying employees to travel for cancer care

**Amazon lets employees travel for cancer care.**

As employer health costs continue to rise for its employees, some companies have gotten pretty creative with how they reduce their costs. We've covered how Walmart and other large firms are very hands-on with controlling healthcare costs. Now, Amazon is joining the trend of allowing its employees to [**travel for cancer care**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-joins-trend-of-sending-workers-away-for-health-care-11571131801) (paywall - WSJ). 

&#x200B;

**The partnership with City of Hope.**

Whereas Walmart lets workers diagnosed with cancer to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic, Amazon is partnering with City of Hope hospital in California. The e-commerce giant will cover all of the travel costs for its workers to seek opinions from City of Hope. 

It's a win-win: employees get access to coverage outside of just the local options, and Amazon aims to lower its healthcare costs when its workers receive arguably better, more effective care from a reputable provider.

# 4. UnitedHealthcare decides to implement site-neutral payments itself

**A push away from hospital based facilities.**

Similar to Anthem's [**outpatient imaging policy**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170826/NEWS/170829906/anthem-s-new-outpatient-imaging-policy-likely-to-hit-hospitals-bottom-line) back in 2017, UnitedHealthcare is trying to shift its covered lives to 'lower cost' settings by [**limiting**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/payment/unitedhealthcare-outpatient-surgery-policy-threatens-hospital-revenue) who can receive outpatient surgeries and procedures at a **hospital-based facility an ""HOPD""** (i.e., an outpatient clinic or surgery center that is actually a department of a hospital). 

Beginning in November, UNH will cover the costs of a procedure at an HOPD ***only if*** it determines that the site of care at the hospital outpatient department was **medically necessary**.

&#x200B;

**The bigger picture - site neutral payments.**

Earlier this year, HHS' site neutral payment policy - meaning that hospital outpatient departments and freestanding facilities would be paid the same - was [**shot down in court**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hospitals-score-victory-as-judge-tosses-cms-site-neutral-rule/563170/). Insurers are always in favor of steering patients to lower cost settings. In this case, freestanding ambulatory surgery centers should be the big winners - and hospitals are getting left out to dry.

# Policy Corner, week of October 21, 2019: Medicaid Work Requirements cost States Millions, Pelosi's Drug Plan passes through Key House Committee, Elizabeth Warren gets pressed on Healthcare, and an Update on the ACA in Court.

**Medicaid work requirements are apparently costing states millions.**

Requiring people to work in order to receive Medicaid was a contentious issue when first unveiled in states like Arkansas. In theory, it sounded like a solid proposal - contribute to your local economy, and get rewarded with Medicaid coverage / public welfare. 

Then, questions arose about the implementation of said proposal. How would the reporting work? Who would hold the individuals accountable? Not to mention scrutiny the policy [**received**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/medicaid/arizona-gives-up-controversial-medicaid-work-requirement) from court. No one really knew whether the work requirements were 'working' (haha) or not. 

This week, we received the first data point: a federal report indicated that Medicaid work requirements are actually [**costing states millions**](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/federal-report-finds-medicaid-work-requirements-are-costing-states-millions#stream/0) based on the administrative costs required to run these programs.

Read the full federal report [**here**](https://www.gao.gov/mobile/products/GAO-20-149).

&#x200B;

**Pelosi's Plan passes a Key House committee.**

A few more developments emerged from the Pelosi Drug Pricing camp this week (which still has [**no chance of passing the Senate**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/19/mcconnell-pelosi-prescription-plan-1504496) as long as Mitch McConnell is around). The drug pricing bill [**advanced**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/18/house-committee-passes-speaker-nancy-pelosis-drug-pricing-bill.html) through the House Energy and Commerce Committee, but still must pass through 2 more committees before it reaches the floor. 

&#x200B;

**Pelosi's Plan gets Vetted by the CBO, Others.**

In other news, the Congressional Budget Office released an [**analysis**](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-10/hr3ltr.pdf) of the drug pricing proposal, finding that the plan would potentially save Medicare around $370 billion over 6 years by imposing price controls. 

Democrats were huge fans of this news, while Big Pharma and Republicans stressed that any proposal that reduced drug revenues this drastically - estimated between $500 billion and $1 trillion - would result in severely less innovation for new drugs entering the market. 

While the bigger pharmaceutical companies would most likely survive, the smaller biotech incubators rely on a lot of early stage financing from investors willing to invest in risky assets. If the reward were to become much more muted, would this investment in biotech small caps still happen? Of course, this is all hypothetical.

&#x200B;

**Other Policy Updates - 2019's remaining agenda, Elizabeth Warren gets pressed on healthcare, and keep the looming ACA ruling in mind.**

Here are Congress and the White House's [**healthcare initiatives**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/special-report/here-s-what-to-expect-from-congress-and-trump-administration-for-rest-2019) to keep an eye on as 2019 comes to a close (where does the time go??). In case you missed it, here's our [**timeline of Surprise Billing updates**](https://thehealthymuse.com/surprise-billing-timeline/) for 2019.

Elizabeth Warren [**received some flack**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-warren-backers-want-more-details-on-her-health-plan-11571509050) (paywall - WSJ) for her lack of detail with her Medicare for All proposal, including how the plan would be funded. She's expected to release some information soon after dodging questions about it in the debate this week. [**Read more background here**](https://www.axios.com/warren-to-release-medicare-for-all-funds-plan-ecf3199e-4e4a-47bc-bd40-3a67d26cd1db.html).

Finally, keep in mind that the ACA ruling is expected to happen [**any day now**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-court-case-imperils-affordable-care-act-some-states-prepare-contingency-plans-11571650207) (paywall - WSJ). Some states are scrambling to keep the ACA in place until a new health law is formed. The White House also has indicated continual support for the ACA until a replacement takes shape (that is, if the law gets struck down).

[Question - Other] Non-insurance based healthcare?,dkofdl,"Currently, I have the recommended plan through my employer, I pay $240 a month and have a $1,600 deductible. That means I have to pay 4,480 a year in medical costs (over 10% of my net income.) BEFORE my insurance provider decides to cover any expenses. I met my deductible in July/August and since then they've denied every single claim. So I'm now 3k in debt due to medial bills with $1,600 of that counting toward my deductible, and then the $2,880 I'll have payed to the insurance company over the year.  I'm already maxing my HSA but trying to get the bills payed on time means money leaves the HSA fast than it gets put in. Hell, I'd actually only be out $200 If i had placed all of that money into another savings account lol.

I don't blame them, their entire business model is based on taking in money and doing everything in their power to not spend it. 

I'm wondering if there are any systems in the United States, specifically Oregon that provide healthcare without having to deal with insurance? Something along the lines of I pay in $300-$400 a month and then just have healthcare now, instead of having to spend a few hours every week talking with someone who has to work in a call center being told all the corner case reasons the insurance company wont pay for my medical care.",2019-10-21 08:56:56

[Question - Other] Health Administration Fellowships and Onsite Interviews,dj91w5,"Hello reddit community,

I am currently in the process of applying to health administration fellowships. I have already completed round one/phone interviews with about 15 organizations, and I am now starting to make my way into round 2/onsite interviews. With that being said, I have 2 questions. 

1.) My first question is does making it to round 2/onsite interviews mean that I have a fairly good shot at landing a position? I have heard mixed things about round 2/onsite interviews such that anywhere from 25-6 people are chosen to interview for one position. I have heard elsewhere that this means a person has roughly a 25% or even 50% chance of landing the position (typically referring to regular jobs and not fellowships for this online statistic). I know that making it to round 2/onsite interviews is a great sign, I just was wondering if anyone has any input on a person's chances.

  
2.) And to start off with my second question... I recently was told that I made it to round 2/onsite interview with a great organization that I interviewed with over the phone. They had told me that they wouldn't let candidates know about if they made it to round 2/onsite interviews until sometime in the middle of next week, however they had emailed me early this week letting me know that I made it to the round 2/onsite interview that takes place over 3 days at the end of this month. With that being said, the deadline to accept/decline is tomorrow morning, BUT I hear back from about 8 other organizations tomorrow (and more next week) about if I have moved on to the round 2/onsite interview. There is one organization that I interviewed with that if I made it to round 2, I know I would have a really good shot at landing the fellowship because the organization is smaller and not through NAFCAS. And, there is another organization that is bigger but had told me that they have an unlimited number of spots for fellows, so if they find 10 great candidates then they will take all 10. From my standpoint, those would be 2 great organizations to interview with onsite since it increases my chances of getting a fellowship.

So, my plan is to accept the round 2/onsite interview from the one organization tonight, but I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with accepting this type of offer and then having to decline it down the road for a better round 2/onsite interview offer. I'm assuming this happens often with fellowships. I know it would be ""dumb"" to not accept this offer because for all I know it will be the only one I get. But, I guess at the end of the day I am just nervous about not landing a fellowship position . . . I guess that's just the risk you take though ?",2019-10-18 06:15:30

In 2018 I had Blue Cross Blue Shield Platinum--it was a whopping $1600/month for only an HMO. Drugs were cheap ($10/$20/$60) and co-pay was like $10. Basically it was $20,000/year ++ a few things were not covered 100%. I needed referrals to see specialists which SUCKED (but the primary care didn't give me a hassle---but I had to do all of the legwork). It offered NO out of network options (no PPO). There was no deductible. I go to the Dr a lot.

The cost is astronomical and I have NO ACCESS to a WORK PLAN. I MUST pay for this myself. I can not get financial help with this (do not meet the income requirements).

I work in a surgery center in AZ and I’m disturbed by how many gloves we go through. I 100% understand the need to constantly change gloves, and have no problem with that. I just hate how many we go thought. When I do check in on a surgery day, I can easily go through 30 pairs between patients and sanitation steps. There are at least 20 other employees doing the same thing, adding to an excess of 600 pairs (that’s 1,200 individual gloves in a day!) this drives me absolutely bonkers so I have been looking into some glove recycling programs and have found a few that work with nitrile gloves, which what we use anyways. My biggest issue is that I’m not a Dr. or N.P and in the grand scheme of things am pretty low on the totem pole. I’m having trouble finding the courage to go to my superiors with the idea of using a recycling program, especially because we are family owned and the owners are pretty cost conscious. I’m really just looking for any advice on how to bring this up in a respectful manner that will actually be looked at and hopefully acted upon. If any one has done this I would appreciate hearing how you got it noticed. Any advice helps! 

TL;DR I work in healthcare and we use 100’s of gloves a day. I want to get a glove recycling program going but I’m no one of importance in our surgery center so I’m not sure how to go about it. Any advice helps",2019-10-09 12:06:17
"[News] Top 6 Healthcare news stories, week of October 8, 2019 - Largest Telemedicine Medicare Fraud Bust to date, Microsoft and Novartis partner in A.I., the Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits surge, Nobilis Health has a REALLY bad day, and everything healthcare policy.",df2dg7,"  

# 1. Telemedicine and the $2.1 billion Medicare fraud case

**The FBI gets a big win in a huge Medicare Fraud bust.**

Under the guise of [**Operation Brace Yourself**](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/billion-dollar-medicare-fraud-bust-040919) (nice name, FBI), the FBI made a major bust in one of the biggest Medicare fraud schemes to date - 24 people were charged in the $2.1 billion heist.

&#x200B;

**This isn't GTA.**

The ring of 24 decided that they were going to inappropriately bill Medicare for medical equipment that patients didn't need. As a part of the scheme, the equipment companies told patients to use virtual care to expedite the process and have it billed by Medicare. After scamming Medicare for $20 million a *week*, the government finally caught on and brought down the hammer.

&#x200B;

**Two peas in a pod - healthcare and fraud.**

Healthcare and fraud go hand-in-hand, especially with Medicare (search 'Medicare Fraud' on Google and let me know how many hits you come back with). Unfortunately, elderly folk are easy targets for scammers. This type of fraud might be a bad side effect of telehealth, since the physicians unknowingly involved in the scam could not physically examine the patients.

# 2. Novartis and Microsoft Partner on Artificial Intelligence in Drug Development

**An A.I. Innovation Lab.**

It doesn't get more buzz-wordy than that. This week, Novartis (a huge pharma company) and Microsoft (you know what Microsoft is) announced a strategic collaboration to advance artificial intelligence's role in drug design and creation. 

&#x200B;

**The Deets.**

The multi-year partnership will build joint research activities and ""A.I. innovation labs"" with the hopes of developing personalized therapies specifically focused on macular degeneration (ophthalmology is big $$$), cell and gene therapy (often thought of as the next frontier in drug development), and overall drug design. This alliance is just the latest example of the transforming life sciences industry.

# 3. Nobilis Health gets delisted, loses 3 executives, and closes 5 facilities

**Bad day?**

[**You could say that**](https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2019/09/30/struggling-houston-based-health-care-co-shutters.html). This week, the NASDAQ notified Nobilis Health, an operator of hospitals, outpatient clinics, and ambulatory surgery centers, that the company is getting delisted from the stock exchange after failing to comply with public financial disclosures - the company hasn't disclosed one since the end of 2018, actually. 

&#x200B;

**When it rains, it pours.**

[**That's not all Nobilis is facing, either**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/hospital-operator-loses-3-top-executives-closes-5-facilities.html). Over the last couple of months, the firm lost its CEO, CFO, and CLO. Over that same time period, Nobilis closed 5 facilities. Finally, not to be outdone, the company's lender, BBVA Compass, is demanding back a smooth $130 million in loans.

# 4. 2020: The Evolution and Explosion of Medicare Advantage

[**Brace yourself**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/payers-roll-out-2020-ma-plans-with-increased-focus-on-social-determinants/564198/) for Medicare Advantage explosion in 2020. All of the major payors are gearing up for the year. [**Cigna**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cigna-tees-up-largest-ma-expansion-ever-for-2020-plan-year) is planning its biggest ever MA expansion. [**UnitedHealth**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/10/01/unitedhealth-group-to-sell-medicare-advantage-in-100-more-us-counties/) is expanding into 100 more U.S. counties (and you thought they ALREADY were everywhere, didn't you?).

&#x200B;

**Supplemental Coverage**

Anthem, Aetna, and Humana are in the mix too of course. What's interesting about the plans going into 2020, though, are the [**supplemental coverage options**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-finalizes-plan-to-grow-supplemental-benefits-medicare-advantage) that CMS is phasing into Medicare Advantage plans. For instance, [**Anthem**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-unveils-slate-ma-supplemental-benefits-for-2020-including-pest-control-coverage) is getting creative with these alternative options, including such services like…pest control. Other offerings might include odd benefits like acupuncture, transportation assistance (shout out Uber and Lyft), and other similar services that could be beneficial to seniors.

# 5. Policy Corner, week of October 7, 2019 - Protecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction

**Trump has a vision for Medicare**

This week at a rally in Florida, Trump gave insight into the [**healthcare executive order**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/03/766816709/targeting-medicare-for-all-proposals-trump-lays-out-his-vision-for-medicare) he had signed earlier that day. Originally titled ""Protecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction,"" the order, now called the more-official-sounding ""Protecting and Improving Medicare for our Nation's Seniors,"" is somewhat lacking in policy, but does give a positive nudge toward Medicare Advantage as the future of Medicare.

The rest of the order includes generic language surrounding lowering healthcare costs, eliminating inefficiencies, promoting innovation, and more.

**DSH cuts get pushed back by Senate**

The ever-looming DSH cuts were [**pushed back once again**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/senate-votes-to-push-back-medicaid-dsh-cuts.html?oly_enc_id=1916A0565789F4V) by the Senate this week. Remember that the DSH, or Disproportionate Share Hospital, program, is designed to reimburse hospitals with a larger population of uninsured or charity cases. Efforts are being made to reform and revamp the DSH program. In other legislative news, lawmakers are looking to repeal and/or extend the delay of the [**medical device tax**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/supply-chain/lawmakers-renew-effort-to-repeal-extend-delay-of-medical-device-tax.html).

**The FDA might have a new head soon.**

Finally, Trump is expected to nominate [**Stephen Hahn**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/trump-expected-to-nominate-dr-stephen-hahn-as-fda-chief.html) as the next FDA commissioner.

[Question - Insurance] I'm in an interesting predicament and am looking for advice. Just recently got a job after being disabled for 4 years and I'm worried I won't be able to pay for my therapy and medications after beginning to work again.,dex1rn," I'm very confused by this whole process, so anyone that could offer me some advice I would be very appreciative of. I'm living in Hawaii County, and have been receiving General Assistance ($388/mo) for the past 9 months. Before a month ago, this was my only income whatsoever.

A month ago, I was offered a remote job in which I am doing systems engineering through virtualization as well as technical writing. It's part time, but I'm now making right above the threshold which disqualifies me from receiving benefits, as well as receiving medicaid.

For people with disabilities, are there are deductions or... really, I don't know the right words for this stuff. How can I manage to pay for healthcare? I feel that if I lose my ability to be on medication and go to my weekly therapy sessions, I may not be able to perform well enough at my job and may go back to being unemployed.

It seems odd maybe, but there are only some very specific jobs that I feel capable of doing. I don't quite fully understand my mental illnesses in their entirety, but sometimes I am so anxious and depressed that I simply cannot function. I want to be productive and self-sufficient, but when I do the math, I'm quite honestly worried that I will have to work less in order to keep my healthcare benefits. There is no way I can afford $400/mo for healthcare. I would be homeless again! I'm seeking a solution, but it's very odd that I've found myself in a position to go from being totally depressed and jobless, to having the best-paying job I've ever had, yet still I may not have enough to get by.

What should I do? I don't want to be worrying about this stuff, but it feels so odd to me to be in a position that I would want to be paid less just so I can keep my benefits. My mental health has been improving, but if I somehow lose the opportunity I was lucky enough to stumble across, I will be right back where I started. Thinking and worrying about how to approach this has distracted me a lot from other things, and I would really appreciate some advice. I'm making around $1,600 a month, which apparently disqualifies me from all of the benefits I was receiving up until a month ago. I feel like I'm repeating myself so I'll just leave it at that. Thanks for any advice you can offer me. Aloha!",2019-10-08 21:48:45

[Other] They dont want to cure us.,de25w7,"We live in a world that places bandades on our issues and treats symptoms instead of addressing the root cause. Healthcare is run by companies like Big Pharma that make money when we are sick. We must understand that no money is made in curing disease only in treating the symptoms. These companies push boat loads of drugs instead of educating us on how our bodies can heal themselves.

Our bodies are self regulating and self healing if treated properly. We must do our own research. We must give our bodies, minds and souls what they need to thrive. Stress is the cause/trigger to so many dis-eases. We must put our mental health in the forefront. We must give our bodies nutrient rich food and cut out man made, genetically modified food which is literally poisoning us. We must remain active as a body in motion stays in motion.

If you are suffering from heart disease, type 2 diabetes, anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal disease, etc.. instead of feeding into your doctors advice for medication, make these lifestyle modifications and watch your body heal. Most doctors never even took classes on nutrition.. they are specialists in a certain system. Remember, most likely the system within the body that is showing symptoms is not even the root of the issue.

If you have physical pain. This is not a bad thing as you have a body which is letting you know something is wrong. Do not mask the pain. Do not simply treat the symptoms or allow someone else to treat the symptoms. Do your research and get down to the root cause of the pain. It most likely stems from somewhere away from the site of the pain. If this pain is chronic it may be past emotional trauma that needs to be addressed and released. As emotional trauma can show up later in life via physical pain.

We need to understand that by addressing the root cause we will have to do work to get well again. There is no magic pill that will make us better.

[Question - Other] non-CAHME MHA Program,ddzw96,"Questions about MHA Programs

Hi everyone, I started an online MHA program at West Coast University and I went into it hastily because my grades were not the best for my undergrad and one of my friends recommended it. They are regionally accredited, but lack CAHME accreditation. There is not much objective information out there from a simple google search and emailing other schools and healthcare institutions has not been very fruitful. I enjoy my program I am in now, but I am worried that I am wasting my time and money for a not so great degree. I just want to say that I went through a lot during my undergrad and it affected my gpa, but I am very motivated to excel and I know that I am capable. I really enjoy healthcare and the duties that administrators have. I am so worried about pigeonholing myself and I hope that the answers I find here will be helpful. I listed some questions below and if you have anything you need to ask me, please do. I really feel lost right now, but I sort of know where I want to be, but just don't know how to get there exactly.

TLDR

1. Is it worth attending a MHA program that is not CAHME accredited?
2. Is it a good idea to just finish the program with a high GPA and hope for the best, or is that just dumb and irresponsible?
3. My gpa is bad, any recommendations to get it up to the 3.0 minimum for other programs?
4. Can someone explain to me fellowships?
5. Any non CAHME fellowships I should look into or other options?
6. I don't know what I'm doing with my life now, please help 📷",2019-10-06 20:39:58
[Discussion] Health Administration Fellowships and Multiple Round Interviews,ddqq12,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering what people's opinions or insight is with multiple round Interviews.

I am currently in the process of interviewing for administration fellowships, and it seems like how I interview for the first round has nothing to do with if I'll make it to the second round.

For instance, I've had 2 really good round one interviews where I didn't make it to the next round. The organizations had even called me to tell me I interviewed really well and that they don't have much advice for improving my interview skills, just that my goals didn't align perfectly with the organization's goals. Then they stated they would help me find other places, and I will find my perfect fit somewhere.
I had another round one interview where I did shit terrible (it was a one-way interview). I thought I knew that I wasn't going to make it to round two. But, I ended up making it to round two.

So I am wondering what your opinion is or insight on these multiple round interviews. Part of me feels like organizations already ranked people based off of their applications, but still interview 10+ more people in round one. I am coming from a new and not accredited graduate program, so I think that may play into the decision as well since most of these organizations require/prefer those from accredited programs (but then why interview me?!). However, I want to be able to interview better so that I am able to make it to round 2 with other organizations. I am just confused because the ones I interviewed well in, I didn't make it to round 2, but the one I interviewed horribly in I made it to round 2.",2019-10-06 07:29:07

[Question - other]Doctors tip?,ddievy,"This happened years ago but its bugged me a lot. No one has provided any answer because they haven't heard of it.

Now I'm Canadian. I was on a trip down in the states. This was probably 2011. On this trip I had a nasty fall off some rock wall and barnacles, roots and rocks ripped open my leg with cuts about an inch deep. Almost hitting my bones.

I recieved 30 stitches after we gave the doctors insurance info. A huge red flag in my opinion. Usually if this thing happens in Canada they start working right away but we were threatened to be kicked out if we didnt have a form of payment right away.

So insurance has us covered. I get patched up return he get a bill 1500 USD. Collections are calling us. But we redirect to insurance. A month later 1500 bill again. This time it says doctors tip. In total it was a 3000 dollar bill. What's a doctors tip?",2019-10-05 17:44:56

[Question - Other] MHA Questions,dd2gtd,"Hello all, I am currently in undergrad getting a bachelors in Public Health. I have found myself very interested in the field of Healthcare Administration and would like to pursue it as a career field. I am leaning towards getting an MHA after graduation from undergrad as it is very difficult to find a job in healthcare administration or public health with just a BS. Some grad schools I’ve looked at explicitly say they want people with experience entering their MHA program while others don’t care.

Is it an issue to get an MHA right out of undergrad with no experience?

Are MHA programs typically very competitive to get into? I’ve found very little info online about this

Does it matter what grad school I go to or as long as they have a fairly good reputation overall is that okay? I do know it is important for the school to have an internship as part of the program, but not much else. 

More specifically, is Rutgers University’s MHA program well regarded? I am in commuting distance so that would be a huge plus. Also, how competitive is it to get accepted to their MHA program?

Thanks so much!",2019-10-04 17:59:09

"[Discussion][News] Summaries of all the top healthcare stories from the week - Amazon pilots a primary care platform for employees, employer sponsored premiums top $20K for the first time ever, 23andMe's push into drug development, and everything else you need to know.",dc0zss,"  

Hey everyone, I'm back! Apologies for missing last week. Here's a recap of what you might have missed last week in the healthcare world:

* Providers scored a big win when a federal judge scrapped [**CMS' Site-Neutral payment policy**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hospitals-score-victory-as-judge-tosses-cms-site-neutral-rule/563170/). 
* The judge ruled that HHS doesn't have the appropriate level of authority to enforce payment policy on hospitals. This ruling was reminiscent of the mandatory television drug ad price disclosure ruling that was [**also shot down in court**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/legal/judge-axes-price-disclosure-rule-drug-ads) earlier this year on a similar principle.
* Nancy Pelosi [**released her plan to bring down drug prices**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pelosi-wants-government-to-negotiate-prices-of-costliest-drugs-11568898000) (paywall - WSJ) - namely, the costliest 25 or so drugs would be subject to direct pricing negotiations with the federal government.
* These negotiations would be tied to an international pricing index, and drug-makers would be penalized for not participating. (If you're so inclined, here's the [**bill in its glorious entirety**](https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Bills-116hr3hi_intro%2009.19.2019_Lower%20Drug%20Costs%20Now.pdf)).
* The Pharmacy Benefit Management industry continues to get challenged by new players and potential [**disruptions**](https://www.managedhealthcareconnect.com/article/general-session-pbm-industry-evolving-or-disrupting). The latest contender, Capsule (similar to PillPack), [**just raised $200 million**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/pharmacy-startup-capsule-raises-200-million-to-grow-beyond-nyc) to take on industry titans like PillPack, CVS, and others.
* Walmart Health continues its surge forward. The retail giant just [**partnered with Amedisys**](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/09/walmart-health-amedisys-partner-to-expand-home-health-access-nationwide/), one of the largest (and still growing) home health and hospice players, to expand access to home health across the nation. Sam's Club is also joining the party by offering a [**pilot program**](https://apnews.com/87286f917cdc440ca5dfc2dfdf0893aa) to its members to offer discounts on certain routine care items (shout out to the Groupon story from a few weeks ago).
* Not to be outdone by the old guard Walmart, Google Health just [**completed its somewhat controversial acquisition**](https://www.blog.google/technology/health/deepmind-health-joins-google-health/) of AI-focused DeepMind, which is expected to further enhance its efforts to [**push into healthcare**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/artificial-intelligence/google-health-takes-over-deepmind-4-things-to-know.html) \- including data security, cloud storage, and other important characteristics.
* Humana's CEO David Jones passed away this week. The WSJ highlights his life and Humana's origins in a [**memoir**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-a-jones-co-founded-humana-creating-a-health-care-giant-11568909260).
* Washington Medicine, MultiCare, and LifePoint Health just [**created a huge clinically integrated network**](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/uw-medicine-multicare-lifepoint-health-create-network) covering 14 hospitals, 6,500 providers, and 600 outpatient sites of care in the Pacific Northwest. 

Now - on to this week's stories!

&#x200B;

# 1. Amazon Pilots Primary Care Platform for Employees

**Another day, another healthcare launch.**

* This week, Amazon launched [**Amazon Care**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/24/amazon-launches-employee-health-clinic-amazon-care.html) for its employees. Basically, Amazon is trying to cut down on healthcare costs (like everyone else), so the company is [**offering**](https://amazon.care/) a slew of primary care options - including virtual care and in-home nurse visits. The initiative is piloting in the Seattle area for Amazon's employees. *Don't tell* [***Whole Foods***](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/09/13/business/ap-us-amazon-whole-foods-health-care.html) *workers about it, though.*

**In other Amazon news…more health wearables tech.**

* Amazon wants to take on the 'ole AirPods. This week, the e-commerce giant unveiled its [**wireless Alexa earbuds**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/amazon-plans-alexa-earbuds-with-fitness-tracking-echo-with-subwoofer.html) containing fitness tracking, among other planned gadgets recently announced.

&#x200B;

# 2. Employer-Sponsored health insurance premiums top $20K for the first time

**A new car a year…or health insurance?**

* A recent [**Kaiser survey**](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2019-employer-health-benefits-survey/) showed that employer-sponsored health insurance premiums [**rose**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/worker-health-insurance-costs-surpass-wage-growth-survey-finds/563756/) to an average of $20,576 for family coverage. It's a bit alarming - the annual premium growth rate has been above both inflation *and* wage growth for quite a while. Employees are increasingly paying a higher out-of-pocket share for healthcare costs. We all know how hard it is to spot a bubble but…are we in a bubble?

As we get closer to any potential breaking point (hopefully none), you're going to start seeing employers take more extreme measures to lower their costs. 

* Such cost cutting measures could include direct contracting with primary care physicians, or self-funding insurance plans with insurance coverage for ""extreme"" emergency spending. Others might opt to cut their labor force.

Employers with larger, concentrated labor market share in local markets will have better leverage to push providers and payors alike for increased transparency and more favorable contracts.

&#x200B;

# 3. 23andMe's predictable push into drug development

23andMe is moving quickly into the field of drug development, and its first push is a predictable and seemingly natural step for the company - [**clinical trial recruitment**](https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/26/23andme-clinical-trial-recruitment/). 

**23andEveryoneElse.**

* Based on all of the information us common folk paid to hand right on over to the DNA testing company, 23andMe is partnering with TrialSpark, a more tech-savvy version of a contract research organization, to recommend customers for clinical trials based on those customers' DNA, demographic or other characteristics.

These DNA testing firms are now sitting on a ton of probably-valuable genetic testing data, and they're not going to sit idly with that (potentially sensitive) information. 

* The more specialized data matching processes might actually be really helpful to drug makers and research teams as they work on developing drugs for tricky diseases. 

&#x200B;

**Remote Access.**

Here's the revolutionary part. As Stat notes in its story, 23andMe and TrialSpark might actually solve what has traditionally been a huge barrier for clinical trials - geography. Instead of needing all of the patients for a trial in one location, the partnership is trying to digitize clinical trials. That might mean that patients could walk into their local doctor's office to report data rather than flying to another facility.

&#x200B;

# 4. Air Ambulance operator Air Methods is planning to cut insurance out and contract directly with employers

**Fed up.**

* After its inability to reach contracted agreements with large payors like Cigna, United, and Aetna, Air Methods - an air ambulance operator (think helicopter care flights) - is cutting the insurance middleman out by attempting to [**contract directly**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/air-methods-in-talks-to-contract-directly-with-large-employers/563604/) with employers.

Helicopter care flights are prohibitively expensive as-is, and even more so if that patient is out of network. By contracting directly with employers like Walmart and Tyson Foods, Air Methods might start the trend of cutting out payors and working directly with employers.

&#x200B;

# 5. Policy Corner, week of September 30 2019

Since you guys are probably getting enough of the whole impeachment thing in the 5-second revolving door news cycle, let's take a breath of fresh air into the world of healthcare policy:

* Mitch McConnell is not a fan of Pelosi's drug pricing proposal. He's already planning to [**block the measure**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/trump-whipsaws-gop-on-drug-pricing-1763102), citing socialist pricing controls. Pelosi's plan [**might have missed the mark**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2019/09/26/the-missed-opportunities-in-nancy-pelosis-prescription-drug-reform-bill/#3d0e3c3d1c70) on other drug pricing inputs, anyway.
* Here's the latest on [**surprise billing legislation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/Here's%20the%20latest%20on%20surprise%20billing%20legislation,%20too.), too.

[Question - Insurance] Just Turned 26... Insurance Question.,d9co9m,"I am an accountant and I just got kicked off of my Aetna insurance that I had through my parents' navy coverage. I am now receiving what i have discovered is bottom-tier coverage through Kaiser and by default, Delta (now Dominion or something). dental insurance.

I have no problem thus far with the Kaiser health insurance, but the dental fucking blows. I went to urgent care this past Saturday because a cavity became infected and was spreading to my neck and face--- they told me to schedule an appointment with the dentist as soon as possible. I tried to call them both yesterday and today and sat on hold for an hour or more each day before being hung up on. I have read online that the only dentists I will be qualified to see all have poor reviews anyway. I called up Kaiser and asked if there was any way for me to pay to sign up for better dental insurance where I can actually call a number and schedule an appointment, but they said I am covered and that I needed to call the same number that just put me on hold for an hour before hanging up on me.

What the heck can I do? I have bad teeth genes from my mom who is always getting some sort of dental work done and I need better dental care. I am willing to pay more for the convenience of being able to call a number and actually have them answer without making me wait. What are my options?

And do these systems have specific protocols in place to steer patients toward ambulatory care where the cost is cheaper per capita for the system?",2019-09-25 13:12:25

Heart Surgery Solutions? [Question - Insurance],d8scbz,"Hey guys. I have a heart condition that while not fatal, is negatively affecting me and I'd really like to be rid of it. It's very fixable with a minimally invasive heart surgery, so I've been considering that. Is there no way for me as a very low income young person, to get this surgery without taking on a massive debt? I dont have a ""career"" tier job yet, and the health insurance I'd be getting through them is horrible.

[Question - Insurance],d8nf6f," My wife was out of work for 13 weeks due to mental illness. For 12 weeks, we were covered by her existing employers health care coverage (Cigna). Cobra insurance was offered to us through her employer for the 13th week where we wouldn't have coverage. My wife is now back to work and her prior health coverage has resumed. Her employer is saying that we must purchase Cobra for the 13th week although we are already covered once again with Cigna. Is this a requirement for us? The cost of Cobra is $1750 which my wife is being garnished for (3 months) since her employer is paying for it, and we must reimburse the company. I guess my question is: If we didn't use any medical services for the 13th week (Unsure yet if we did or didn't) why would we be required to purchase this coverage? I assume that if we used services during that 13th week and the cost exceeds $1750, Cobra would be the better option. However her employer is saying it has to be purchased either way. Does anyone know about this stuff that may be able to explain to us?",2019-09-25 03:16:19

"[News] An update on Surprise Billing with Congress back in session for the fall. Current legislative initiatives, industry pushback, and everything in between",d60fpx,"# The current Surprise Billing predicament.

Things were going smoothly. Surprise billing had adversaries closing in on all sides. [**Proposals from Congressional leaders**](https://khn.org/news/sen-alexander-details-his-plan-to-fix-surprise-medical-bills/) were taking shape, and it looked like a surprise billing solution was inching closer to the finish line as legislation [**hashed out**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/senate-committee-tackles-surprise-medical-bills-5-takeaways.html) the details.

***

**Texas and California make a Surprise Billing push.**

Meanwhile, states were making their own push against surprise billing. [**Texas** ](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/18/733369370/texas-is-latest-state-to-attack-surprise-medical-bills)and [**California** ](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/payment/california-surprise-billing-law-takes-spotlight-federal-fight)became two of the dozen-or-so states with legislation either partially or fully banning surprise billing practices.

Each state developed its own way to deal with the issue (Texas with third party arbitration between the provider and insurer, California with previously agreed upon, benchmarked median in-network rates for out of network emergency bills). But *at least* the states enacted the legislation and tried something.

At the federal level, it looks as if we're currently in complete gridlock.

***

**Surprise Billing comes to a not-so-surprising halt.**

As Congress returned to class in September after its summer recess, the lobbying scene was flooded with a huge amount of pushback on the surprise billing front.

The culprit? A '[**dark money**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/13/health-groups-dark-money-hospital-bills-legislation-1495697)' group apparently backed by major national physician staffing companies.

Given this development, many national media outlets are calling the surprise billing initiatives a stalemate.

Both sides - **providers**, who favor third party arbitration - and **insurers**, who favor rate-setting benchmarks for out-of-network care - aren't giving up any ground yet. As you can tell, the issue is quite tricky.

**Translation**: we might be back to where we started, despite all the back-and-forth rhetoric.

**Don't give up on surprise billing yet, though**. Congressional leaders in the House [**launched an investigation**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/house-leaders-investigate-private-equity-firms-over-surprise-medical-bills) into private equity groups that back these physician staffing companies, meaning that at least some want to continue forward.

We'll see if any major surprise billing initiatives come through the federal level. For now, I would turn your gaze toward the states.

***

TL;DR. Bi-partisan support for surprise billing largely exists and is very real. But insurers and providers [**can't compromise**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rifts-emerge-over-congressional-move-to-curb-surprise-medical-bills-11562751015) on a solution. With a new provider group lobbying to take down any surprise billing legislation, we might be in for a long ride.

[Question - Other] Canada/Quebec or global comparing studies on waiting times for preventive measures (specialist consultants and preventive surgery)?,d5zob3,"Hi there,

I checked some facts about Germany, Japan, Canada/Quebec that are not trivial to understand when I **try to understand differing waiting times and communication with hospitals/clinics in those countries when it comes to prevention** (or ""non-urgent patients""):

According to sources like this on [data.worldbank.org](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS), some seemingly relevant basic facts:

Japan and Quebec have **roughly the same coverage of doctors** (2.4 doctors per 1000 citizens) and **similar individual health care payments to fund the public health system** relative to the countries' GDP (e.g. Japan 11% of GDP; QC 12.5% of GDP).

It seems that roughly saying in Canada wait times at least for preventive measures are quite long.

**Q:** Are there studies that break down major factors or known issues concerning waiting times and availability of consultants and surgery (staff / teams) into anything that improves their availability and efficiency?

...i.e. studies that explain inefficiencies or best practices in communication, administration, staffing, staff motivation, etc. that could or do explain effective differences in countries' surgery waiting times.

What I'd expect - not sure since I'm still (re)searching - are comparisons between Canada/QC and other countries (where applicable and ""fair"") with possible factors being:

Ideal numbers of staffing (consultant/surgery specialists AND all surgery assisting roles) relative to number of patients (or per citizen), administration & communication, motivation (work hours, salary, workplace culture/morale, etc.), and a few other key factors regarding a mix of private and public hospitals/clinics (like Germany's combination 30% public and 70% private hospitals).

**Just FYI, rough information for more context:**

Facts or estimates I gather from my own experience, articles, and personal posts:

In Japan waiting times for a specialist consultation and **even preventive** surgery (dermatology & preventive surgery, mammography & breast biopsy, colonoscopy & removal of polyps, etc.) are around a few days, at least an appointment and treatment/surgery all within roughly one week or two.

In Germany waiting times for preventive measures are a bit longer than Japan in some cases, but still within a few months at most. Germans actually pay a bit more relative to their GDP. 70% of hospitals are private, still mainly covered by the public system and, I think, integrated into the public network (centralized databases, common referrals between public and private doctors, etc.) ... which is a bit odd: the German system is in some places a tad less efficient than in Japan, still very good.

In Quebec waiting times for consultation in those areas can be up to roughly 2 months to 1 year, and for a following preventive surgery around another 5 months to 3 years (highly depends on the field and what your actual hospital/clinic is).

About Canada in general I only sampled a few scattered numbers, for example Ontario seems to have similar preventive consultation/surgery (and ER) waiting times compared to Quebec. And Quebec is even one of the states doing better in Canada, at least in some areas of health care and prevention.",2019-09-19 05:17:03

"[News] Top healthcare news stories from the week of September 17: Apple, Google, Amazon, & others battle for the healthcare cloud, the good, bad, and ugly of hospital mergers, everything policy from the week, and the transforming PBM industry",d5hhc1,"# 1. Battle for the Healthcare Cloud

**Electronic Health Record Battle Royale.**

The battle is heating up between Big Tech titans as they [**compete for health data storage contracts**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-amazon-and-microsoft-in-battle-to-store-health-data-in-the-cloud-11568122202) (paywall - WSJ) with big-time health systems. As one of the final frontiers for Amazon, Google, and others, these Cloud contracts could get a foot in the door to work with healthcare folks that could result in long, lucrative relationships that expand beyond just the Cloud.

Recent Cloud deals announced included [**Google and the Mayo Clinic**](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-selects-google-as-strategic-partner-for-health-care-innovation-cloud-computing/), Microsoft and [**Providence St. Joe'**](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/microsoft-providence-st-joseph-partner-long-term-cloud-innovation-project)s, and plenty of others. Generally, the agreements really are just for storage of healthcare and financial information. But we already know that Big Tech has plans to expand capabilities further, like including electronic health records and finding clinically useful information for trials and other treatments.

Of course, these developments come with a slew of problems - namely, privacy concerns (shout out HIPAA) and security issues (healthcare companies literally get hacked all the time) so…we'll see where it goes from here.

Tech firms don't care, though. How mad would shareholders be if they missed out on the market expected to reach $100 billion by 2025?

\---

# 2. The Sobering Reality of Healthcare Tech?

**Is a healthcare tech disruption in sight?**

All of this talk about Big Tech has me thinking…how far ARE we from seeing true 'disruption' in healthcare?

The answer is….[**we're not quite there yet**](https://www.axios.com/health-tech-innovation-hype-poll-young-people-03d226d8-7442-43f2-80e5-e1e88190b280.html). As Axios reported this week, the healthcare system - and providers in general - have a bit of a ways to go to catch up technologically. We're moving in the right direction, but patients still don't really use much tech to actually benefit their health outcomes…yet. And the end result of healthcare innovation might be a [**bit messier than we think**](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/why-one-app-to-rule-them-all-is-not-the-future-of-digital-health/)**.**

Still, there are plenty of positive and incremental takeaways each year. In its annual keynote, Apple [**announced 3 health studies**](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-announces-three-groundbreaking-health-studies/) \- actual health studies - that will incorporate its Apple Watch in hearing, women's health, and heart health (maybe in response to [**this open letter**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-apple-open-letter-regarding-healthcare-from-schwartz-md/)? And there are plenty of promising medical device and similar startups that could revolutionize methods of treatment.

**Bad actors.**

Don't forget that reality always eventually sets in. Investors pouring money into the system might leave thoroughly empty handed. Just look at what happened with Theranos and now, uBiome's bankruptcy.

\---

# 3. The good, the bad, and the ugly of hospital mergers

**Controversy.**

A report published from the AHA this week caused a bit of a stir from everyone, as its findings indicated that hospital mergers resulted in lower healthcare costs, among other assertions.

**Opposing viewpoints.**

Economists [**disagreed with the view**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-transactions-and-valuation/aha-says-hospital-mergers-are-good-economists-say-otherwise.html), saying that mergers resulted in higher costs. Providers argue that mergers may be necessary in order to maintain leverage with insurers, improve operational performance, and provide better population health management.

What do you think? [**Read the full report here**](https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2019/09/cra-report-merger-benefits-2019-f.pdf).

# 4. The Transforming PBM Industry

**CVS Deal gets approved.**

After a tumultuous 9 month run, a federal judge finally managed to [**approve the CVS-Aetna deal**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/federal-judge-signs-cvs-aetna-merger-after-post-deal-review) this week, paving the way for CVS to officially acquire Aetna (even though they've been operating as one entity for…almost a year). The approval comes at a time when CVS, traditionally a PBM player, is trying to transform its business model and the healthcare industry - even [**hiring a former Fitbit exec**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/cvs-hires-fitbit-executive-to-lead-consumer-health.html) to lead its consumer health division.

**Pharmacy Benefit Management's evolution?**

Ironically enough, though, the first industry to see significant change may be CVS' core business of pharmacy benefit management. New startups are springing up, aiming for more transparency around the typically-shady PBM practice and a generally more consumer-friendly approach to the business. And don't forget the heat the industry faced earlier this year from Capitol Hill.

Read for yourself an [**interview with PBM startup Capsule's CEO**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/pharmacy-industry-is-finally-seeing-a-much-needed-change-capsule-ceo-says.html), who talks about the changing industry.

# 5. Healthcare Policy Corner - Week of September 13

**The Congress Strikes Back**

Here's a preview of Congress' fall healthcare agenda:

* Lowering prescription drug prices - potentially allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies
   * [**Pelosi's Plan**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/pelosi-s-draft-drug-pricing-plan-allows-direct-negotiation-imposes-fines.html), which includes the above direct negotiation tactic, might actually have bipartisan support
* Finding a solution to **surprise medical bills**
   * But as of now, it looks like Congress is [**facing major pushback**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/back-in-session-congress-faces-industry-pushback-on-surprise-billing/562518/) from industry leaders on surprise billing - from an extremely well-funded [**dark money group**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/13/health-groups-dark-money-hospital-bills-legislation-1495697). We might have to wait a bit for more surprise billing legislation.
   * Look for more action at the state level.

&#x200B;

Other healthcare things to look out for this fall:

Unveiling Trump's healthcare plan (expanding Medicare Advantage, giving states more leeway, etc.)

Resolving Gun-control disputes

In other policy news, HHS is [**releasing $1.8 billion**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/hhs-releases-18-billion-funds-fight-opioid-epidemic) to combat the opioid epidemic. And it looks like a top doctor from Texas, Stephen Hahn, is a top candidate to [**replace Scott Gottlieb**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-doctor-stephen-m-hahn-is-a-top-contender-to-head-fda-11567635140) as the head of the FDA.

The office is a part of a large Catholic-based healthcare organization. I have my associates degree and have taken some of my nursing courses, but have never finished a program due to time constraints with work. I was planning on enrolling in my local community college ADN program next fall, but now I am thinking about getting out of healthcare all together. This is due to the changes and overall attitude I have noticed encompassing the healthcare world in the United States. Recently, the organization I work for changed all of their provider intervals from 30 minutes to 20 minutes, in order to increase the number of patients seen. Ever since this change we have been swamped. Who knew that 10 minutes could make such a difference. And on top of all that, we are told that they cannot hire another full-time Medical Office Assistant, because it's not in the budget.

Now, I probably speak for a lot of people when I tell you that I got into nursing and healthcare because I genuinely care about people. I think healthcare is increasingly driven by money and it frustrates me so much. I don't think that providers can offer the level of care that patients deserve. They are too busy during the day to slow down and really spend time talking with patients. On top of that, they have to spend time documenting and coding all these things, which takes time away from the patients. Patients are often sent to specialty offices when it is not really necessary and have to undergo expensive procedures/testing. It's a waste of everyone's time and resources.
I am growing weary seeing amazing providers become overwhelmed and constantly worrying about their numbers. I highly doubt that it is any different elsewhere because that is the nature of the healthcare system in our country. I have such a passion for caring about people, but that passion is being stifled by the way the current assembly line/hamster wheel practice model.
I just want to discuss this issue with like-minded individuals and see what you think is the solution. Should I continue to pursue nursing or should I get out now? If I do continue to pursue nursing, what can I and other nurses do to change anything? Oftentimes I feel like this problem is too big, which makes it feel hopeless, which in a way is what has brought me here. Is there anything we can do? Do you see this changing anytime soon, or is it going to continue to spiral downward?",2019-09-07 07:27:03
"[Question - Insurance] I need to find a therapist, but I don’t understand how to start the process",d06l2i,"Hello! I have Blue Shield insurance in California, and I know I would benefit from some mental health help. I’d prefer to avoid medications for now, so I want to talk to a therapist/psychiatrist.

When I looked on the app at my coverage it indicates a $40 copay and it doesn’t count towards my deductible, and then it states this:

“Blue Shield's Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) administers and delivers the Plan's Mental Health benefits. All non-emergency Mental Health, Residential Care and Substance Use Disorder services must be arranged and prior authorized through the MHSA. For referrals or prior authorization, contact Blue Shield's Mental Health Service Administrator by calling toll free”

And I don’t quite understand. Do I call the number and say I would like to try therapy? Will they assign me someone, or should I find one I might like first and then ask? Should I go to my PCP first and request a referral?

Thank you in advance!",2019-09-06 10:17:34
[Other] PSA: How to home test for appendicitis,czwroi,"(I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post this, I just thought this was important information everyone should know. If I should post it elsewhere, feel free to delete and let me know.)

I was recently admitted to the hospital for appendicitis, and was fortunate enough to know how to self-test, so I went in while still in the early stages (the CT showed 'some inflammation, but the appendix is on the upper edge of normal size') and was able to get away with antibiotics instead of surgery. So I thought I would share how to do that, to hopefully help others avoid an unpleasant hospital visit.

If you get a new and unusual cramp in your stomach, in my case accompanied by gas-like bloating and nausea/vomiting, do this very, very simple test:

Step one: On your right side, locate the midpoint between your hip and belly button.  
Step two: Slowly push in as far as you can  
Step three: Suddenly let go. If that causes you to double over in pain, GO TO THE HOSPITAL. Let a medical professional examine you and decide whether or not you're right.

My high school biology teacher taught me this over a decade ago, and a couple weeks ago, it quite possibly saved my life. At the very least, it saved me from surgery. I would describe the appendicitis pain as 'mildly uncomfortable' unless I was performing that test, so if I hadn't known how to/that I should perform that test, I would've simply written it off as bad gas. I've had periods MUCH more painful than that, so know I would've just 'dealt with it' and not gone to a doctor for *days.* It probably would have ruptured first. But because I knew about this test, I went to the hospital that night, was diagnosed with early stage appendicitis, spent 3 days under observation, 2 of them with IV fluids/antibiotics, got a prescription for 8 antibiotic pills to be taken every 12 hours until they ran out, and just took a bus home. I have to see the surgeon again in 5 weeks for a follow-up, and that's it. Overall, it was a very painless experience (other than the 5 tries it took to stick the IV in me).

I am fortunate enough to be Canadian and will never see the bill for this, but for any Americans reading who are afraid of paying for a wasted emergency room fee: What's more expensive, an emergency room visit ending in nothing, or an emergency appendectomy because you waited? My final tally was 3 bags of saline, 3 or 4 bags of antibiotics, one shot of anti-nausea medication, one shot of painkillers, one shot of anticoagulants, and 2 nights in a room. Yeah, that's probably a few grand right there... but still less than emergency surgery, or a funeral. And if you feel any of those shots are unnecessary, you can probably refuse (I would've been fine without the painkiller and anti-nausea).",2019-09-05 19:23:10
"[Question - Other] Looking to sell health care software, not sure where to start",czobys,"Hey there, 

So I've posted on here before about some of my ideas. After talking with doctors, I think I've found two that would help doctors. 

The first one is a simple form filling application. From mobile or web, quickly search, select, fill, sign, and print a form. Be it a government form, referral, or internal hospital. I've even found one doctor who has created something like this for himself because he got sick of it. I have a working demo for this.

The other is creating digital hand off sheets. Tracking of how a patient is feeling, make it easy to share with a department, doctor, or nurse in a hospital. There would also be a patient task list of things that need to be done, in progress, or have been completed (marking when and by who). Kinda stealing a bit from jira and other project management tools. I'd be looking for a hospital partner with this.

Both of these solutions would be sold to hospitals. I'm not sure how to get my foot in the door here. I'm located in southern Ontario, Canada. 

Any ideas of how best to contact a hospital for a partnership to develop the second idea, and sell the first one?",2019-09-05 07:25:27
"[News][Discussion] Top Healthcare News from the Week - Vaping Illnesses Spike, Wal-Mart's Ambitious Healthcare Expansion, Peloton Rides the Wellness Trend Wave, Audits for Medicare Advantage, & Gleaning into Trump-Care",czn59d,"  

# 1. Vaping Related Illnesses are Spiking

**The Vaping Epidemic.**

The CDC is reporting [**hundreds of vaping-related illnesses**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/459426-more-than-200-vaping-related-lung-illnesses-reported-to-cdc) across 29 separate states, which is a huge spike in what most might think is a 'safer' practice in vaping. Apparently, most of the incidents are happening because of [**third party, foreign substances**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/as-vaping-related-lung-illnesses-spike-investigators-eye-contaminants/2019/08/29/cfe26032-ca78-11e9-be05-f76ac4ec618c_story.html) (like THC) somehow making their way into the vapes. 

The exponentially increasing number of reports shows us just [**how far behind vaping regulations are**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/vaping-lung-disease-regulation-1686396) when it comes to preventing these sorts of things. Forget about the shady marketing tactics. Now, real health scares are coming into the picture as a result of the wild-west vaping industry. Look for more potential regulation to hit the main stage soon.

&#x200B;

# 2. Audits for Medicare Advantage, and DOJ Investigations for Providence

**CMS wants to audit Medicare Advantage.**

Medicare Advantage (AKA more or less Medicare plans managed through big insurance companies) has been a huge boon for the health insurance industry and the main driver of growth on quarterly earnings calls. So it comes as no surprise that the big insurers would ***strongly*** oppose any regulation on their biggest growth vehicle.

&#x200B;

**What's the looming regulation?**

As Axios reported this week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid want to audit Medicare Advantage plans to make sure that the plans are not billing Medicare for more services than they ought to be. They're calling the audits ""risk adjustment data validation.""

&#x200B;

**Insurers Hate This One Thing!**

Insurance companies had plenty to say about the pending regulation. Centene even had enough nerve to warn that the regulatory action could cause further market consolidation…

&#x200B;

# 3. Wal-Mart's Healthcare Expansion

**Enter: Wal-Mart Health Clinics.**

In direct competition with the likes of CVS and other direct to consumer primary care-type offerings, Wal-Mart has decided to [**make an even more serious push into healthcare**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/walmart-is-piloting-health-clinic-at-walmart-health-in-georgia.html) by opening up primary care clinics. 

Its pilot store opens in Georgia and looks to offer quite the decent selection of offerings for consumers, including dental, optical, audiology, and other entry-point services for…you guessed it…everyday low prices!

# 4. The Wellness Trend

**Banking on Wellness.**

This week, Peloton filed its [**S-1 form**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000119312519230923/d738839ds1.htm) \- they're expected to IPO later this year. As Nathaniel Meyersohn noted on Twitter, there was a little nugget in their S-1 that [**noted the wellness trend** ](https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-connected-fitness-files-for-ipo-2019-8)happening in the U.S. has been a huge boon for the Peloton business. As we all know, Peloton sells overpriced, glorified stationary bikes with a fitness subscription on top of it (and they're still not profitable…that is beyond me). 

But Peloton's recent success shows the push that wellness has made into society, especially among employers, who are now [**offering wellness programs**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/from-wellness-to-well-being-the-evolution-of-employer-health-initiatives/561851/) that include everything from on-site yoga to stress management (I should note that the jury's still out as to whether or not these types of programs are effective), to more robust offerings like [**mental health screenings, tele-health, and women's health**](https://www.healthpopuli.com/2019/08/26/the-new-employer-wellness-lens-includes-mental-health-telehealth-and-womens-health/). 

&#x200B;

**Fitbit jumps in to care management.**

Don't stop with just the employers, though - traditional 'generalized' medical wearable makers like Fitbit and Apple are jumping in on the trend, too. In fact, the former is looking into [**piloting a care management program**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/fitbit-to-wade-into-care-management-in-pilot-this-year/561867/) for its users later this year.

&#x200B;

# 5. Policy Corner

**Obamacare, meet Trump-Care.**

Some additional clues about ""Trump-Care"" emerged this week from an NPR feature. Some components of the plan might include recommendations made in a white paper published by the Department of Labor in 2018. The white paper made note of various reforms like expanding the roles of health savings accounts, heightened anti-trust scrutiny, and (ironically) easing restrictions around Medicare Advantage plans.

[**Read the full article**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/09/03/755990796/what-would-trumpcare-look-like-follow-gops-choice-and-competition-clues) for more insights into a potential Trump-Care offering. Also, don’t forget that the ACA is still tied up in court and might make it back to the Supreme Court for a third showing. 

Be on the lookout for any potential healthcare proposals this month as Uncle Sam ramps back up for the fall.

[Other] This insurance agent for Bluecross just bitched me out and I don’t know what the fuck to do cuz I still need insurance!,czd4l1," So I just got off the phone with them. I called them earlier today because I just realized I had a lapse in my coverege ( I thought my college BCBS auto-renewed and it didn't).  Whatever, I decided I would shop around a bit before I decide on a plan, because you know...I'm in college. Insurance is expensive.   Problem: I didn't know a lot about my options, so I just called up and asked for a ""FREE QUOTE"". This guy talked with me a bit and said I should look at my options and whatever, and that I could call this number some other time because I have a complicated custody situation w/ my grandparents who are on Medicare, so I cant exactly be on any ""family plan"".  -Forget this guy he's not the one Im about to talk about.

  Around quarter after 6...this guy named Ryan ( I think?) calls me and says that he was referred to me. Okay, cool.  I ask him how much it would be, keep in mind it was 6 I wasn't exactly expecting a call, and he said like $150-300...thats a pretty big range.  I told him I think I would be able to afford it, but I wasn't exactly sure yet. Keep in mind I don't exactly have a stable job right now so I don't know what's gonna happen in a month. Plus I'm a full-time student.  I ask him if I could call him back...HIS RESPONSE!  ""NO YOU CANT CALL BACK! HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT INSURANCE. IM TRYING TO HELP YOU BUT YOU GOTTA HELP YOURSELF!  The hostility...it was just shocking. I went silent after that. It was like, one of those ""okay what the actual fuck?"" moments. He then gets mad at me for being silent, and I mean, that doesn't help it only makes it worse cuz I'm like, super confused as to why he's getting belligerent with me.  

 HE THEN HANGS UP ON ME! Before I can even say anything, like I could hear he was pissed off in the background, too, like right as he hung up. I was about to just say fuck it and be like ""Dude, I didn't do anything to you.""  But yeah, I was uninformed on my options cuz...and this motherfucker decides to get pissed at me. Like dude, you're the one selling me insurance. I never raised my voice at you!  I wanna call back cuz I mean, I need insurance, but legit I am afraid he is gonna be the one who answers and I don't know if I have the social skills to deal with that.   So I mean, thank you BlueCross BlueShield.

"[News] Healthcare's Biggest Stories, week of August 29 - Johnson & Johnson gets hit with a $572 million fine, Amgen buys Otezla for $13.4 billion, personnel trouble at Apple Health, and everything healthcare policy.",cx2teg," 

## 1. Johnson & Johnson Opioid Ruling

**That’s painful.**

This afternoon, a judge [released the verdict](https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-572-million-in-oklahoma-opioid-case-11566850079?mod=hp_lead_pos1) (paywall – WSJ) of the first of many trials determining whether Johnson & Johnson specifically contributed to the Oklahoma opioid crisis. The state of Oklahoma asked for as much as $17 billion in fines from J&J, claiming it would cost that much to recover from the damage done.

While the judge found J&J liable, the fine was set at $572 million, which is about 3% of what Oklahoma asked for. And of course, since the fine for Johnson & Johnson wasn’t as big as expected, the stock shot up around 3% immediately after the news broke. The company will appeal the decision, too.

&#x200B;

**That’s not all.**

This court case is the second of many trials taking place around the U.S: Purdue Pharma [settled for $270 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-opioids-litigation/purdue-pharma-agrees-to-270-million-settlement-in-oklahoma-opioid-case-idUSKCN1R70CH), and Teva Pharmaceuticals settled for $85 million, also in Oklahoma. We’ll probably be seeing some more drug makers coughing up big bucks here before too long.

After all, there are almost 2,000 opioid related lawsuits out there right now, and almost all of them have consolidated around a federal court house in Ohio. Keep an eye on that case, which is slated for October.

## 

## 2. Cue up the next blockbuster drug deal – Amgen is buying Otezla in $13.4 billy deal

**In Monday’s other inflamed news story…**

Amgen [announced their plans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amgen-shows-price-is-still-right-for-blockbuster-drug-deals-11566830905) Monday to buy the highly successful, lucrative anti-inflammatory drug Otezla from Celgene for a whopping $13.4 billion deal (keep in mind that Celgene is getting acquired by Bristol-Myers-Squibb).

&#x200B;

**A Win-Win Deal.**

As the WSJ points out, this deal was pretty much a huge win for BMY since the drug maker was required by the FTC to sell Otezla anyway. Amgen is a fan of the deal too, since patents on the blockbuster drug don’t expire until 2028. It’s the latest deal in the usually highly active biotech space, which hasn’t been too active since January of this year.

## 

## 3. Apple’s Health division faces personnel challenges

**Secret’s out.**

[Tensions are rising](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/20/apple-health-employee-departures-show-split-over-ambitions.html) inside Apple’s health division personnel. The highly secretive health operation has seen executives departing for other healthcare firms and ventures after growing frustrated with Apple’s progress in disrupting healthcare along with its various healthcare philosophies.

Apparently, while Apple is focusing more on bigger picture, general population health and incremental progress, individuals were hoping to solve more specific problems within healthcare at a quicker pace with more focus. That issue, coupled with more philosophical problems, led to the departure of quite a few employees.

&#x200B;

**My thoughts..**

I’m all for the ambition, but the healthcare industry as a whole moves as slow as molasses to adopt any new technology AS IS. Some practices still transfer data via fax. I’ve even heard of one physician who had no clue what Microsoft Excel was. (FYI – the CNBC article linked above also has some interesting insights into Apple Health’s operations and structure, if you’re into that sort of thing).

&#x200B;

**In other Apple healthcare news…**

The tech giant just announced a strategic partnership between Allscripts and Apple Health Records. [According to the release](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/allscripts-touts-deal-with-apple-health-records/561556/), Allscripts will now let any patient using the platform access their personal healthcare data via iPhone – even if using several providers.

## 4. Higher temperatures create more health problems

**Sticky.**

As if you haven’t heard enough about climate change, NPR [published an article this week](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/24/753511276/when-temperatures-rise-so-do-health-problems) highlighting the negative health effects that come along with rising temperatures. The story details how health problems and mortalities rose drastically during summer heat waves in various cities.

Don’t forget though, that some may stand to gain from rising temperatures. Since diseases spread more easily in higher heat environments, [**Axios pointed out in January**](https://www.axios.com/climate-change-global-warming-drug-companies-profits-aa3e54e3-fe7e-43b4-bcc8-2c55699cacb9.html) that warming global temperatures could be a huge boon to Big Pharma and drug development/sales to counteract the potentially higher occurrence of diseases if temperatures continue to rise.

## 5. Healthcare Policy Corner

&#x200B;

Widespread critics are speaking out against the administration’s [**Public Charge Rule**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/458627-critics-fear-widespread-damage-from-trump-public-charge-rule)expected to take effect in October.

**What’s the Public Charge Rule?**

Basically, the administration is looking for more ways to control immigration. As a way to deny people from receiving green cards, the admin created a rule that limits immigrants from receiving public benefits for more than 12 months.

For instance, if said immigrant were to use Medicaid, which is a designated public benefit under the Public Charge Rule, for more than 12 months within a 36 month period, that individual would then be denied a green card.

&#x200B;

**How does this affect healthcare?**

Since Medicaid is listed as one of the public benefits, healthcare providers (including the AHA) and state officials alike have warned the admin, saying that [Medicaid enrollees would plummet](https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/public-charge-policies-for-immigrants-implications-for-health-coverage/) as a result of the rule.

Lower levels of Medicaid enrollees would lead to higher percentages of un-insured populations, which means providers would potentially be faced with much higher levels of uncompensated care, worse health outcomes in their population, and worse financial outcomes that they and the state would eventually have to pay for, anyway.

As you can imagine, several states are suing and we’ll see where all of this ends up.

&#x200B;

**In other policy news…**

Democratic Senators aren’t fans of Medicare for All policies. Instead, according to Politico, both representatives in battleground states and incumbents alike favor supporting the [healthcare rhetoric already floating around](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/25/democrats-health-care-senate-1678301): expansion of Medicaid at the state levels, and adding public insurance options to states. But they’re shying away big-time from touting Medicare for All.

What if: New National Teaching Hospitals churn out cheap physicians [Discussion],cwzfs5,"It's an epiphany to me. The US health system's most fundamental problem is monopolistic practices by healthcare providers who profit from high barriers to market entry--basically a choke hold on the supply of healthcare, causing fantastically high prices (contributed to by debt-ridden doctors).

What if we used government not to run the system, but to break the supply choke hold? We could convert our disaster of a VA into a network of teaching hospitals for government-subsidized physician training.

What would the consequences be?",2019-08-30 00:43:49

[Discussion] Hospital Messaging Applications,cvron8,"Hi Again!

A while back I asked about what people's thoughts were about building an EMR for hospitals. I've had a bit more time to think, and I'm back for more feedback if you guys are willing. I've decided to try and build this out module by module.

I'm thinking of starting with messaging applications. I know of at least one hospital in Canada that doesn't have one, and doctors turn to other means. I'm trying to contact them to see why they don't have one. I know there are a few on the market right now. 

A few key things I think would be required

* Device management. The ability to remotely wipe the local database of the application for either a specific device or all apps for a user.

* Authentication with a single sign on service. I hope hospitals use one, and I would try to integrate with their service. 

* Secure messaging and file sharing. Everything is encrypted at rest and in transit.

* Auditing. Have an admin portal where a hospital administrator can monitor chats.


A few things that I think would be useful to a hospital

* Having a single space to message or call the on call doctor. The app would integrate with a scheduling system to figure out who is on call for any department at any moment and be able to send a regular or urgent message, or call them. 

* EMR integration to share a patient chart for a patient that's about to transfer to someone else and you want to give them a heads up, or to get a second opinion from a colleague.

* Group/Department chats. Be able to start a group message around a patient, or have a single room for an entire department.

So what I know this is kinda a bare feature set. What do you guys think? 

What would be one feature that you would start a campaign for your hospital to switch?

What kind of system does your hospital use?

Thanks for your time everyone. I greatly appreciate it!",2019-08-27 07:35:08

"[Discussion] We need a patient ""Bill of Rights"" where patients can not be treated like cattle going to the meatpackers.",cucrc2,"Gotta say my my blood pressure was sent skyhigh with this weeks experience in a hospital with my wife's treatment. The general attitude that dominates the healthcare industry in the US hit is square on the head.

 - endoscopy procedure was set for Monday so the surgeon could look at a tumor in my wife's stomach for himself before the scheduled surgery the next day. So no food or drink after 7pm on Sunday night (he wanted a completely empty stomach). We we told 10am at the surgery dept. So we show up and after getting into the preop room, a nurse writes on the info board her name and the time for procedure to be 3:45pm....like WTF is that? Show up nearly 6 hours beforehand? Thats when the fun begins.
 - So we are now irate, we know NO procedure ever begins on time as ORs and surgeons overbook and the welfare of patient AND their family is their least concern. The goal is MAX thru=put and billing out of the OR suites. My wife has had 10 surgeries over 25 years and I myself worked behind the scenes in healthcare for over 10 years as architect/PM. I know the process all too well.
 - anyway, its 4:30 before she goes in for procedure. Procedure takes 10 minutes, 5 minutes later the surgeon talks to me about what he saw and the plan is for the next day. I casually mention why were we told to be here at 10am and have to wait so long as now it will be nearly 24 hours for my wife going without food or drink? He looked ""puzzled"" and since he is cutting on her the next day, I wasn't going to make it a big deal for obvious reasons. We both left pissed for the hour drive back to our house
 - next day, back the hospital at 10:30 am for the surgery. So we are ushered back to the preop room, I tell the nurses at the station outside our room please be advised there are ""2 angry old people"" in that room and we are in not humor for issues today"". We are both over 66 yrs old and pissed. I asked, is surgery still scheduled for 12:15 and they say yes.
 - Well wife is so severely dehydrated from the day before, they had to stick her 4 times to take blood, took 2 tries to get an IV into her and of course she is weak from going on nearly 40 hrs now with limited nourishment as well. I make this all clear to nursing staff from the getgo.
 - 12:15 comes and goes, and silience for the staff, finally at 5min to 1pm, a nurse came in and I stopped her in her tracks before she could take my wife's vitals> I said I need an immediate update on revised surgery schedule as there is a computer in the room she can access their intra-web.
 - She sees that the OR that my wife's surgery was scheduled for had a procedure started at 11am....so I go off: ""like WTF is this? You knew 1.5 hours ago the surgery wasn't happening any time near 12:15?? "" AND I HAVE TO demand to be updated???"" I was primed now.
 - I demanded to see the nursing supervisor of the dept and when she came in 5 minutes later, lets just say she EARNED her pay that day. 15 minutes I read her the riot act starting with the fiasco yesterday (not sure where the fault was but didn't care). And when the typical ""platitudes"" like, ""We know ORs run late"", I stopped her with...""That is NOT THE FUCKING ISSUE""....its a total lack of COMMUNICATION and the fact that the patient and family is NO CONCERN TO YOU OR THE HOSPITAL. No way should we be placed in this position as the wellbeing of MY WIFE is being threaten by YOUR actions....

The surgery was successful as it could be. I am have filed formal complaint with the hospital thru their ""patient liaison"" people and will file one or 2 complaints with IDPH which can bring holy hell to any healthcare provider in Illinois. I am 1 of 1000 people who walk thru the doors of the hospital who knows what IDPH stands for as I had to work with them for certification of the hospital work I was involved with.

The contempt of healthcare to patients has to stop. The ability of surgeons to KNOWINGLY bring people and their families in for 6-8 hours before surgeries has to stop. This is the MAJOR complaint of the pre-op staff in every hospital I have seen as it forces them to deal with people like me that have had enough. We are people, we are under stress and building anxiety without having more being placed on us by sheer contempt and disinterest in our plight by the healthcare industry, doctors and hospitals.",2019-08-24 01:17:07

[Question-Insurance] Insurance question on behalf of fiancee,ctxkvh,"Hello

Please bear with me as I do not know enough about insurance :(

I am 23[M] and fiancee is 22[F], her dad recently quit his job and she lost the insurance she previously had -- I believe he quit 2-3 months ago.

She is going to school full time and working part time, it is a medical program with 3 full business days of clinicals and 2 full days of classtime. Initially we went on healthcare.gov and essentially applied for medicaid/CHIP, though unfortunately we applied during the summer where she was working full time (Basically she worked full time from June-August) -- Not sure if that ruined her chances but she was denied, my assumption was because she did have reasonable income during that time.

Are the best options

1. Just get married (Ideally we would do this when she is done with school, ~OCT 2021
2. Go on marketplace and buy insurance out of pocket? Not really sure how this works, and now healthcare.gov seems to be shoehorning her into her previous medicaid application. Does she need to remove her application for that to proceed with marketplace options?

Apologies if I broke any rules or did not provide the correct information, I should be fairly available to elaborate or answer any additional questions.",2019-08-23 03:09:04

[Question - Insurance] Wife and I want to quit jobs for 6-12 months or longer. What insurance options do we have?,ctlbul," 

Hi Everyone,

I posted this on a financial independence subreddit and I got a lot of push back and the moderator eventually closed the post.

My wife and I now 34 and 32 and healthy want to quit our jobs or take a break (if they let us) for between 6-12 months. We have enough money saved to live for the next 5 years or so in our emergency fund.

With that being said - I am concerned about health insurance. If we quit, is our only option Cobra?

What if I quit my job and decide to go solo proprietorship? What are my options for healthcare and can I just ""Sign up"" or do I have to wait for enrollment periods.

I truly think that healthcare and the complexity of the system stifles both solo proprietorship and entrepreneurship just because its so confusing and people are extremely scared to get sick while not insured let alone have a catastrophic car accident or sports injury.

Has anyone else left their jobs to take a sabbatical or try to start a business? What options do I have? We plan on going on a country wide road trip and traveling to many national parks and hiking.

So my concerns are: Car accident bodily injuries and hiking injuries. Rollen ankles, Torn knee ligaments etc..",2019-08-22 08:30:24

"[News] Top Healthcare News, week of August 20 - the latest privacy battle: DNA data? Is employer healthcare spending reaching a breaking point? SmileDirectClub is going public. And everything healthcare policy you missed!",csztih,"  

# 1. Want cheaper surgery? Go on vacation.

**An all-inclusive resor- er…wait - hospital?**

Save this wild story down for later. To reduce costs on healthcare, some employers - like Ashley Furniture - have been flying down patients ***along with*** physicians to Cancun, Mexico in order to perform surgeries and other procedures. 

As KHN reports, one patient flew from Mississippi to meet an orthopedist from Milwaukee to perform a knee replacement surgery, and the patient was *paid for it* \- that's how much less it was to have the procedure done in an upscale hospital in Mexico rather than in America. Like, literally less than half as much money. Absolutely wild! 

[**Read the whole story here**](https://khn.org/news/to-save-money-american-patients-and-surgeons-meet-in-cancun/).

&#x200B;

# 2. The latest privacy battle: Patient DNA data?

**The latest privacy battleground.**

This week, the [**Wall Street Journal reported**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deals-give-drugmakers-rights-to-dna-data-11565607602) (paywall) on recent hospital system and drug-maker partnerships to access patient DNA information. The partnerships are aimed at advancing drug development, or other research-oriented purposes. But they might not be the most forthcoming with patients as to how they're using patient data.

&#x200B;

**How it works.**

Patients are given a free genetic test that shows them risk of various diseases and vulnerabilities, but they're not necessarily told how their genetic data might specifically be used by companies for drug development or other commercial purposes.

Keep an eye on this one as genetic sequencing becomes more commonplace.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 3. Is employer healthcare spending reaching a breaking point?

**Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall….**

Healthcare costs have risen for everyone - that's a given. But because the U.S. healthcare system is set up how it is, employers foot a larger portion of healthcare costs. In an interesting and detailed brief from Axios, it turns out that the [**system could be close to a breaking point**](https://www.axios.com/employers-health-care-costs-premiums-deductibles-9e074deb-467e-4e81-b0c3-97259324bfe6.html).

As these costs continued to rise for employers, companies shifted more of their healthcare costs to their employees (hello, high deductible health plans).

&#x200B;

**What does shifting costs to us do?**

On top of an already high deductible, patients end up [**having higher premiums**](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/tracking-the-rise-in-premium-contributions-and-cost-sharing-for-families-with-large-employer-coverage/) along with more responsibility to pay for their medical bills. Given these set of facts, the rise of out of pocket spending and healthcare inflation could be unsustainable and lead to a crisis.

&#x200B;

# 4. Policy Corner

**What's your plan??**

Democrats and basically everyone else were asking the Trump admin what the replacement healthcare policy would be if Obamacare were to fail in court in its 3rd victory lap around the Appellate Circuits. Never fear - Trump's health chief came out and let everyone know this week that officials were [**actively working on an Obamacare replacement**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/457574-trump-health-chief-officials-actively-working-on-obamacare-replacement-plan). 

&#x200B;

**Any details yet, or nah.**

The plan itself is skimpy on details so far, but we DO know that officials are targeting a September release date, and we would expect the plan to include certain elements like ending surprise billing, giving states more wiggle room on policies, potential drug pricing solutions, and more.

&#x200B;

**In other Trump news…**

The administration just hit the brakes on a law that would have [**stopped 'unneeded' CT and MRI scans**](https://khn.org/news/trump-administration-delays-law-reducing-unnecessary-medicare-imaging-ct-scans-mris/), since officials faced some backlash from physicians who thought the policy was disruptive to their practices.

&#x200B;

**Cadillac Tax repeal.**

Finally, it seems pretty likely that the Cadillac Tax, a tax on more 'generous' insurance plans, would be repealed this fall. [**Here's some background on that**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/14/750859901/cadillac-tax-on-generous-health-plans-may-be-headed-to-congressional-junkyard).

"Top Healthcare stories from the week of August 14 - Opioid distributors get a BIG time fine, Drug data manipulation at the FDA, Apple's devices can catch early signs of dementia? and everything policy. [News]",cqgvvf,"## 1. Opioid distributors are about to get a BIG TIME fine.

## That’s a big fine.

The big distributors of opioids were already expected to be on the hook for a hefty fine stemming from the opioid crisis, but it turns out that the fine is gonna be [**QUITE a bit more than expected**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/opioid-makers-said-to-propose-10-billion-settlement-to-end-state-lawsuits.html) – a range between $10 billion to $45 billion. As you can imagine, the news hammered drug distributors McKesson, Cardinal Health, and Amerisource Bergen, who would be on the hook for the settlement cash.

The companies combined are currently dealing with close to 2,000 lawsuits in 35 states stemming from the nearly 76 billion pain pills that they distributed during a 6 year period (according to the DEA). The prosecutors argued that the drug distributors, *in particular*, didn’t respond to signs of opioid abuse, and engaged in shady marketing.

Don’t forget that companies like Purdue Pharma, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Johnson & Johnson (heard of them?) are also on the hook for the crisis, too.

&#x200B;

## 2. Drug Data Manipulation at the FDA

## Finessing the FDA.

Faithful readers of the Healthy Muse might have seen Zolgensma (*gesundheit*), a drug that treats spinal muscular atrophy in children, making the news in the past few months for its unprecedented $2.1 million price tag. Now, it turns out that the drug’s maker, Novartis, may have [**manipulated and hidden some of the trial data**](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-data-accuracy-issues-recently-approved-gene-therapy) from the FDA.

## High stakes.

While the FDA maintained the drug is still safe and should remain on the market, questions are still arising as to whether or not Novartis [**knowingly manipulated the data**](https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/06/novartis-was-aware-of-manipulation-of-data-supporting-gene-therapy-approval-fda-says/) and covered it up. The stakes were high – according to Stat, if the FDA had known about this extra data, the drug’s approval most certainly would have been delayed.

Novartis [**claims**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/456575-novartis-ceo-says-organization-can-stand-proud-after-hiding-manipulated) they were as transparent as possible. Some members of Congress are pretty upset and want the FDA to take [**criminal and civil action**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/456867-democratic-senators-urge-fda-to-take-criminal-civil-actions-against-drug) against Novartis, the most expensive drug in history, and the big, bad pharmaceutical industry.

## 3. Can the iPhone and Apple Watch detect dementia?

## Dementia Detectors.

In this week’s cool health-tech story from Healthcare Dive, Apple and Eli Lilly are trying to determine [**whether the Apple Watch and iPhone can detect dementia**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/apple-eli-lilly-research-whether-devices-can-detect-dementia-signs/560500/) in patients through small research studies. Basically, they’re observing whether or not common trends exist among those with dementia/cognitive decline as opposed to healthy individuals.

## Some promising results.

As it turns out, preliminary results seemed to indicate that individuals with symptoms of dementia displayed differences in device use as compared to healthy folks, including “slower typing, less regularity in schedules, fewer text messages, and greater reliance on helper apps such as the Clock app.”

Pretty interesting stuff, and could be just the beginning of a deep dive into earlier detection of dementia.

## 4. CVS’ counter to Amazon Prime

## Prime 2.0

Last week, our third story touched on the [**PillPack – SureScripts fiasco**](https://www.healthymuse.email/top-healthcare-news-week-of-august-5-2019/), where traditional PBM heavyweights are taking on Amazon’s attempted entry into the market. Now, CVS is taking on the online retail giant in another way: through a subscription-based model [**similar to Amazon Prime**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/cvs-expands-amazon-like-membership-carepass-nationwide.html).

## Take that, PillPack.

As the traditional drugstore evolves its offerings into a healthcare wellness hub, CVS is offering CarePass – a $48 annual subscription – to customers, which will include free delivery of its drugstore products AND prescription drugs. If that’s not enough for you to consider the service, CVS is also including a monthly $10 coupon, too. I don’t know about you, but I’d say that’s a pretty decent offering.

## 5. Policy Corner

## A new healthcare plan from the Trump administration?

[Question - Other] I'm curious as to what type of work a research assistant performs for a health insurance company about issues regarding state regulations.,cnc6iu,"Hello /r/healthcare,

&#x200B;

I'm about to start a research assistant position next Monday at an insurance company and they want me to do work on things about state regulation. I'm a pretty capable social scientist with background in psychology and communication and I'm a bit stumped as to what kind of work I should expect while I work there. I take my research work rather seriously so I prefer to walk into that office next Monday with my eyes open on what they expect me to perform with at least \*some\* background knowledge I can gain beforehand.

A brief description of the company is that it is seeking to expand into new markets and need to know about the state by state legal hurdles that need to be managed before they step into that particular market. (I think)

&#x200B;

I've searched on google for some similar work positions and these are what I came up with that sounds similar to what they've described.

1)

&#x200B;

Do any of your have a more in depth understanding of the position that could help describe the day to day workings of being a research assistant for a health insurance company to study state regulations? Is it just literature review? How is research performed with a topic that sounds almost legal in nature.

&#x200B;

I have been barely recently looking into insurance, I’m sorry if I seem narrow minded.  I figured you guys could shed some light or give me some advice for my situation.

I got hired in the beginning of summer at a bank, as a seasonal employee working full time hours. Now, anyone who works full time at this bank, is eligible for Healthcare though our employer. BUT since I was a SEASONAL employee, this didn't apply to me. 

A month passes by, and I landed a permanent job here as a Part-Time employee. After the summer is over I will be working part time hours (which is around 25 hours a week) but for the meantime, I am working full time hours.

[Discussion] Too few nurses = lives at risk. Best summary yet of the dangers of understaffing?,cn8mms,"Saw this image [in the nursing subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/cbk3hp/this/). Had almost 2,000 upvotes:

[https://i.redd.it/4bnhkvr1ni931.jpg](https://i.redd.it/4bnhkvr1ni931.jpg)

I recognized it, cause it's gone viral before. Seems to have been originally posted [on Facebook last November by NurseRecruiter](https://www.facebook.com/nurserecruiting/photos/a.389026921172806/2369782166430595/?type=1&theater), who in turn seem to have gotten the idea [from an earlier r/nursing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/9xgqdj/short_staffing_is_in_a_way_like_driving_drunk/).

NurseRecruiter later devoted a blog post to the [many heartrending responses](https://blog.nurserecruiter.com/you-agreed-short-staffing-is-like-drunk-driving-so-why-did-nurses-who-tried-to-do-something-about-it-fail-in-massachusetts/) the image provoked. For example:

>""I wish I could clone myself to have some help. It feels like we’re being set up to fail. We are stretched so thin as it is on top of being short staffed every shift. They can’t keep the new nurses they hire and the ones who have stuck it out are burning out. I can’t blame anyone that moves on for places with better staffing and pay. I just wish someone would hear us.

And:

>It was scary! Too many patients on one nurse, they are all sick, on numerous meds, no way to do everything that needed doing. Couldn’t find needed equipment. It was awful. The patients need more care and attention than they are getting … I was running as hard as I could, not stopping for anything. I still felt I needed to do more.

The research, they write, ""has stubbornly kept confirming"" that understaffing endangers the lives of patients, with [a recent study](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/low-nurse-staffing-levels-directly-linked-to-higher-patient-mortality-stud/543676/) finding ""that the hazard of death increased by 3% for every day"" a patient experienced below-average nurse staffing levels.

A [previous blog post on nurse-to-patient ratios](https://blog.nurserecruiter.com/why-are-nurses-once-again-heading-for-washington-dc/) highlighted studies that found that ""when one nurse has to take care of more than four patients .. the likelihood of the patient dying within 30 days increased by 7% for each extra patient"" and ""that the average patient experiences three shifts where nurses are clearly understaffed, and with each of those shifts their mortality risk grew by 2%"".

And yet, efforts to guarantee proper nursing care keep coming to nothing. California [successfully implemented](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1118) mandatory maximum numbers of patients per nurse, but it's still the only state to have done so. A ballot initiative to get [minimum nurse-to-patient ratios in Massachusetts](https://blog.nurserecruiter.com/you-agreed-short-staffing-is-like-drunk-driving-so-why-did-nurses-who-tried-to-do-something-about-it-fail-in-massachusetts/) ran aground on a massively funded counter-campaign by hospitals and other employers. A push for [federal legislation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1602/related-bills) went nowhere.

"[Question- Insurance] How do the self-employed pay for health insurance in the US? (Young adult starting new career, please help)",cn2a8b,"I'm moving and starting a new job within the next couple of weeks. I'm really thrilled to start a new career and life and everything, but here's the catch, it's a contract position (ergo I'm not eligible for benefits and will not be until promoted to a salaried position) and am going to lose my state benefits because I will make too much money within the first month.

Alright, I figure. I know health insurance is expensive, but I can bear the brunt of it until I make it to a salaried position. Well, it looks like a decent plan would run me about $450-500 a month. And that is just simply out of reach for me. It seems I'll be making too much to receive subsidies, but not enough to live comfortably while also paying for an adequate health insurance plan. This is causing me so much anxiety, I'm not sure what to do about it. It's a full-time position, so I also can't comfortably squeeze in a part-time job (I.e. Starbucks) without working 60 hours a week. I really want to pay for a normal health insurance plan but it just seems so impractical that rolling the dice with my health may actually be the better option here.

Furthermore, I'm only 24. From what I understand, that should mean I can be included in my parents' health care plan? My dad decided to go uninsured for a year a couple of years ago. After that happened I started applying on my own to the state insurance. I have qualified up until now, but I know I will lose my benefits within a month of working in my new position. Can I still receive coverage under my dad's plan (my mom receives state insurance), even after applying independently for two-three years?

I've asked my dad to call and inquire about this and I've offered to pay the difference in whatever the cost would be to add me to his plan (if there even is one) but he simply will not even call his insurance to even ASK ON MY BEHALF. It just doesn't make sense. It makes me question whether he is actually even insured.

TL;DR: Am I missing something? Will it really cost me $400/$500 a month to stay insured at an income of about $35,000 a year (Wisconsin)? Can I be added to my dad's plan (assuming he has one) until I'm 26 even if I've been applying for health insurance independently the last three years?",2019-08-07 20:09:31

Long story short, I'm in California, I've had Medi-Cal for several years, but last fall my S.O. got a new job with benefits. I now am covered through Kaiser Permanente through his work as a domestic partner. I know he applied for it sometime near the end of 2018, I received an actual, physical Kaiser Permanente card just a few months ago.

So once I knew for sure I had active coverage, I tried to cancel Medi-Cal. 

Except I can't figure out how. Or if it's even possible to have two different insurances. 

I am extremely intimidated by the health insurance system, and I have put off seeing *any* doctors because I don't know how to deal with this Medi-Cal/Kaiser issue.

&#x200B;

Thank you.",2019-08-07 08:02:46
[Other] [Discussion] Canadian Healthcare - What A Joke,cmtr2u,"Female - 25 years old - Canadian Citizen.  
Let me be clear, I am grateful that Canadian health care doesn't cost me an arm and a leg.. Though the situation I'm in angers me as I can't get the help that I am in dire need of. I have been dealing with a form of Anxiety and Depression for at least 5 years. This past May there was a huge shift. It seems that after I experienced a Thunder Clap Headache my mental disorder took a turn for the worse. I was ordered to quit my job by my Doctor as I couldn't (still can't) get out of bed or do anything really without me feeling like my heart is going to jump out of my chest and me vomiting.

My depression has made me consider suicide more times than I can count. I have had more bloodwork in the last couple of months than I have in my entire life. I started to see a woman that performs tuning forks, sound healing and a swath of other techniques to help maintain my debilitating condition. She informed me that this might be something to do with my Endocrine system. So, I decided to talk to my doctor about getting tests done for it. She refused to do any testing other than an Ultrasound to ""humor"" me. I talked to another Doctor and she ordered a bunch of blood work to see how my hormone levels are. I received my bloodwork first, with that telling me my Cortisol levels are 3x higher than they are supposed to be as well as my Estrogen categorizing in the post menopausal stage... I'm 25 years old.. Skip a couple of weeks later and I get my Ultrasound results back. Low and behold they couldn't find my ovaries and they found 3 tumors on my liver (I'm an occasional drinker, nor do I drink much when I do).

My doctor now believes there's an issue. She ordered a CT of my entire abdomen and pelvic area as well as an X-ray of my chest as I used to be smoker. She believes that there may be another tumor somewhere else in my body that could be causing the influx of hormones being sent throughout my body. She doesn't want to rule out Cancer either. The X-Ray was easy to get in, I get to see the results tomorrow. The CT however is going to take two months to get in, that's even with my Doctor putting an urgency on it.. If she hadn't it would have taken upwards of 6 months.

I have been on 7 different medications over the past 2 years to try and manage my mental disorders. They work for a little while but about 3 months in I seem to build a tolerance and they stop working, even on the highest doses. Right now I am on Zoloft and Propranolol. They have both stopped working, I tell my Doctor over and over and over again that they are not working. She now ignores me.. So I decided to wean myself off of them. I feel exactly the same as I did when I was taking the medication.. Like absolute crap. It took me 3 hours to get out of bed, like it does every day. I sit at my keyboard with my heart pounding, feeling very weepy, the same cramps I've been feeling in my pelvic area for the past month and random shots of pain where my liver is.

The point of my rant is the fact that the Canadian Health Care System is a joke for the people that are experiencing extreme health issues. Most of the doctors just want to bring you in, prescribe you medication that probably wont work and push you out. The wait time to get tests done to see if you are dying or not are concerningly long. I never believed anyone with their stories of finding out they have Cancer when they are in the fatal stages because it took to fu\*\*ing long for anyone to figure anything out, until now. I am at the point that I would rather be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in exchange for finding out if I am going to live or die sooner.

But Alas, I am just a regular Canadian. I am not important enough or wealthy enough to get the results and treatment that I need. So all I get to do is sit on my couch broke, scared, and on the verge of suicide daily because I just can't handle the fact that I just don't know what is wrong and if it is going to be fixed in time.",2019-08-07 07:12:00
[Question - Insurance] Can I opt out of my employer provided healthcare and be eligible for ACA?,cmt5g0,"Rundown: My employer provided meh level of healthcare at an exorbitant rate for a family of my size, and I would like to change to something else. 

Dilemma- Our ""open-enrollment"" period is now, in August, to begin in September. 

Since ACA enrollment doesn't begin til November and doesn't kick in til January, my options are to take my employer provided now and add on ACA in January until I can drop my employer provided again at this time next year, resulting in 150% cost increase of my current rate for over 9 months, or drop my employer provided now and be without with a family of 5 for 4 months and pray we don't get sick.

[Discussion] Application Of Blockchain And Smart Contracts In Healthcare,cknydn,"Blockchain has so many facilities and the best thing is that it gets rid of the middlemen altogether, so anyone won’t have to pay any intermediate anymore. But what if this blockchain technology introduces smart contracts that change the very nature of how everyone do business today? This system really saves up a lot of time. They have their fair share of problems. However, they are one of the cheaper, faster and more secure methods than all traditional means. Smart contract suits best to those industries where an automatic executing process will be useful. Since smart contracts are meant to solve numerous problems, which will make certain difficult processes simple and available. There is no doubt that smart contracts exert an innovative influence on the financial sphere. Intermediaries are left behind when companies choose to use smart contracts for their projects. Smart contracts can be useful when recording and storing financial data and information, making transactions, and completing payments. Not all agreement types, however, can be elaborated with the help of the blockchain technology.  

 Blockchain supports and maintains people’s security when running a business or launching a startup. Likely, in order to avoid negotiating agreements without intermediaries or third-party services, numerous businesses solve their problems with a simple smart-contract code. Also, it is significant to mention that today's blockchain technology is highly considered a breakthrough in the field of healthcare industry. As application of blockchain and [smartcontracts](https://blog.kucoin.com/real-world-examples-of-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-in-industry-sk-rd) in healthcare are growing bigger, it is enhancing the overall healthcare system. While it is true that there might be **endless possibilities of smart contracts**< which can be applied to the real world, it really is noteworthy how it can improve the absolute necessity in healthcare industries. Definitely looks like the future of healthcare industry is provided by a horizontal innovation boost that it desperately needs.

# 2. Digital Health IPOs Rock Wall Street

**Big ROI.**

How are all of the [**recent digital health IPOs**](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-stock-price-digital-health-ipo-2019-7) faring? Let’s take a peek:

–**Livongo** surged 48% from its $28.00 offering price.

–**Health Catalyst** boomed 59% from its $26.00 offering price.

–**Phreesia** is up 46% over its $18.00 offering price.

–**Change Healthcare** is up just a *meager* 11% over its $13.00 offering price.

&#x200B;

Needless to say, the [**digital health IPO wave**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-health-tech-companies-join-parade-of-ipos-11564059833) that just hit was…pretty successful for the companies taking place. Considering that digital health was previously in a 3-year drought without an IPO, I’d call that a pretty good run. And you could argue that the market in general is in an IPO frenzy as companies rush to raise money before any recession hits.

&#x200B;

**Digital health IPOs – an emerging trend?**

The IPO success could pave the way for future digital health IPOs, too – like [23andme or SmileDirectClub](https://www.businessinsider.com/venture-capitalists-on-digital-health-ipos-livongo-smiledirectclub-2019-5) – as private investors get more friendly with [exit strategies through the public markets](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/technology/digital-health-companies-see-new-exit-strategy-ipos).

# 3. Tenet Spins Off Conifer and the Desert Healthcare Network play

**Spun off to the masses.**

After trying to sell its revenue cycle management arm, Conifer Health Solutions, Tenet is now looking to [**spin off its subsidiary to the public markets**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/tenet-to-spin-off-revenue-cycle-management-arm-conifer/559414/), creating a separately traded public company.

Tenet’s stock shot up on the news since Conifer is pretty profitable (23% margins on adjusted EBITDA) and investors want a piece of the Conifer pie. That demand could signify the hot market for healthcare data and payment management software.

Interestingly, CommonSpirit Health owns a small stake in Conifer, which is something I didn’t know before this story broke.

The transaction is supposed to take place by the second quarter of 2021, so still a decent ways away. Tenet wants to make sure that the spin-off transitions well and is tax-free for all parties involved.

&#x200B;

**In other Tenet news…**

&#x200B;

**Meanwhile…**

Not to be outdone, the Dems are expecting to release a [‘bombshell’ drug pricing bill in September](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/454192-pelosi-aide-major-bill-to-lower-drug-prices-coming-in-september). The bill might include some component where Medicare directly negotiates with drug-makers on price. Here’s some background on [how that might look](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/whats-the-latest-on-medicare-drug-price-negotiations/).

The [**Cadillac Tax**](https://www.healthcare-economist.com/2019/07/21/will-the-cadillac-tax-increase-or-decrease-out-of-pocket-cost/), which taxes high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance plans, is not too popular in Congress. The House recently voted to overwhelmingly repeal the ACA provision.

[Discussion] Do Others Feel This Way?,cjvx3q,"One Guy's View of The American Healthcare System

&#x200B;

I'm 53 and i've never been to the doctor much.  Generally the only reason I sought out any medical service was because I had to..  for work or whatever.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago I went to the eye dr. for an exam and they took my blood pressure.  It was way high - like scary high.  I had a follow up appointment a couple of weeks later, so I layed off of the salt and started eating better.  They took my pressure again at the followup and it was even higher.

&#x200B;

This scared me enough that I went and bought a BP cuff and started checking twice a day.  My pressure is indeed consistently to high, so I thought I would go see a Dr.  Problem is, what doctor?

&#x200B;

Last time I went to the Dr was about 6 years ago and it was the Dr that delivered my kids.  Only one I knew.  Since then we have moved, so i had no idea.  Finally I hit upon my insurance companies web site list of in network providers.  looked up an internal medicine Dr that was taking patients, called, and was told that I had to go through another Dr.  Looked for a GP that was accepting patients and called.  They told me that Dr may or not be taking patients and they would call me back to let me know.

&#x200B;

Four days later they call me back and said that Dr wasn't accepting patients.

&#x200B;

I'm done.  I have made the sobering decision that I would rather take my chances than deal with this healthcare system.  I know a number of people will say that I haven't tried nearly hard enough, but that just makes the point that we are more the victims of the American healthcare system than the beneficiaries.  I pay $23k/year for healthcare that sucks and I still can't get an appointment in a reasonable time with a reasonable amount of effort.  

&#x200B;

Everything in our healthcare system is designed to gate-keep and fleece you rather than provide healthcare.  Yes, healthcare is given, but that is secondary to making money.  I've prepaid for the healthcare buffet, and as with real buffets, they have an incentive to make it hard to get what you payed for.",2019-07-31 07:59:37
[Question - Insurance] Worried about mental health and transition from military to civilian market,cjs6cv,"Hi there, thanks for your time upfront.  


I am in the military and am in need of some mental health attention.  


I have a wife and 3 kids. I am looking at getting out in the next 2 years. My kids are healthy, my wife is on multiple medicines for BPD, PTSD, and a number of other diagnosed issues. She relies on her talk therapy, physical therapy, and psychologist. None of this is to say that this is a problem, only that I have only ever had to deal with the insurance side of things from the military's perspective.  


I have never had to deal with medical insurance on the civilian side and the idea of finding coverage that will work with the expensive prescriptions and appointments for my wife is already stressing me out.  


Now I definitely need attention, my wife has brought that to my attention, and I agree. Nothing life threatening, just need to get on a prescription.  


My questions are:

(1): Is mental health, anxiety on my part, BPD, PTSD etc on my wife's considered ""preexisting conditions"" and how difficult will it be for me to find a decent insurance package when I am out? I will be making close to if not just at 6 figures, for what it's worth.

(2): Is it in my best interest to wait to get attention for my issues until I am out and with a new insurer?

This was over a week ago, and every day I receive 4-10 calls from salespeople trying to sell me health insurance. 

 I try telling them I'm not interested.  I try blocking the numbers but many are restricted numbers I can't block.  I even lost my temper and yelled at them to stop calling me.  I tried lying to them saying I purchased health insurance already.  Nothing works.

"[Question - Other] I'm thinking of developing a new EMR system, thoughts?",cio46u,"Alright, so this might end up being a wall of text. If there's a better place to post this please let me know. 

**Background**

I'm currently working on a medical billing platform for Ontario Canada doctors and their billing agents (if you know one we're looking for user feedback and early adopters).

**What I want to develop**

What I want to develop is an open interface standard for EMRs. This standard would give details on splitting the database that runs an EMR system and the front end applications. This enables custom development for specific use cases, that can be done by my company or any other company. No vendor lock in. 

This would also mean places like the reception desk at a clinic can have a different, tailored user interface and the doctor in the room can have a different one for them. 

I want to start at a clinic level and grow to apply this to the hospital and health information region levels. 

To start I want to find a couple of clinics to partner with for initial feedback and development.

**What I'd like to know**

Does this sound like a decent idea?

Is this something you would recommend or buy for your work?

What features would you need and what features would be great to have?

What do current systems cost?

Thanks for your time!",2019-07-28 12:18:08

I recently went to a specialist I saw on the UHC healthcare site. I've been there twice, 450 bucks a pop, and my insurance didn't cover any of the costs even though it was IN NETWORK. I had to call them in order to proceed with the procedure but I'm curious if this kind of mess up is common from insurance. I don't expect them to cover all of it but them making me hit my deductible before they start assisting seems pretty shitty. Am I just being naive or should I give them a call to see what is up. If it is no copay shouldn't the DRs office at least tell me nothing is covered?

Here is what the website says...

Previously someone said ""people who's job it is are doing it"". Well, I don't see any evidence they are. Where are the reassessments of caesarean as was called for 4 years ago? Where are the reassessments of antibiotics for GBS? 

Moreover, where is the systematic review of the literature and updating of doctors and changes in practice? Where are the systematic reductions in procedures and prescriptions deemed unnecessary with potential harm?

None of these things seem to exist. Specifically in the US, but in a number of other countries as well. Eg:

A staggering 36,000 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are published each year, on average, and it typically takes about 17 years for findings to reach clinical practice (2017): https://catalyst.nejm.org/implementing-evidence-based-practices-quickly

We don't have 17 years to fix these systemic microbiome and chronic disease problems. They are spiraling out of control, and if we lose our host-native microbiome that's been evolving alongside us for thousands/millions of years we may never get it back.

There's been [a ton of new microbiome research in the past 4 years](https://microbiomedigestdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/2000-2016-graph-pubmed.png). It doesn't seem like guidelines and practices are keeping up with it. 

Most of the guidelines seem to only take into account the threat of resistance. Up to date guidelines would take into account the known damage of antibiotics that extend far beyond resistance.  



&#x200B;

Patients can't be expected to read and interpret the literature themselves. My experience with this is that it is not effective to try and spread info to patients in a non-systematic way. Patients can't be expected to be well informed on these issues, and seem to often make emotional decisions contrary to the evidence, even on the rare occasions when they do review it. Though I know [even some doctors who work close to these patients do the same](https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2410/rr). 

It's incredibly important for there to be a body of experts who's primary job it is to review the latest literature and update guidelines accordingly (and those guidelines need to be readily enacted), but there seems to be severe deficits, if not a complete absence of such. Eg: c-section rates that vary drastically from hospital to hospital within the same country/state [[1](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/04/one-in-three-us-births-happen-by-c-section-caesarean-births)][[2](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/arsdarian-cutting-the-number-of-c-section-births/)].

Previously I was arguing something related (informed consent, and reducing unnecessary procedures where antibiotics are required), and at least one person misconstrued my argument to mean I was advocating against antibiotics during surgery. They mentioned BMJ's GRADE system to me so I went ahead and checked what I could find. 

The only thing I was able to find was a 1990 article saying antibiotics aren't always necessary during c-sections https://www.bmj.com/content/300/6716/2. Yet as far as I know, they are given out 100% of the time in the US. Also, the article ignores collateral damage done to the human microbiome, but that's not surprising considering it was written in 1990. But I cannot find one written in the past 10 years.

I also found: Antibiotics are the main cause of life threatening allergic reactions during surgery (2018): https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k2124",2019-07-24 01:57:43

[Question - Insurance] Actual costs lower than agreed insurance amount; adjustments added,cgd7he,"Hello all.  On a medical bill we've received, the provider's actual charges for the service rendered are (significantly) lower than the agreed amount insurance would pay. The provider then added an ""adjustment"" to the bill which brings the total up to the agreed amount insurance pays, plus 20%.  Our insurance coverage for this requires us to pay 20%, so we're billed for the remaining 20% above the agreed insurance payment.  So essentially they've adjusted the bill upward to get the agreed insurance payment plus our 20% payment.  Is this normal?  I understand when charges are over the agreed amount the provider must write-off the difference, but I was surprised to see they would tack on an adjustment, and in this case they will end up receiving nearly twice the amount of the charge for the service provided.",2019-07-23 02:58:38

She quit her previous job due to no longer enjoying the work and her coworkers. I believe her previous job offered better healthcare however. I knew this but she absolutely hated her previous job so naturally I encouraged her to do what makes her happy. After she started her new job, we were both surprised at the lack of organization. Altbough I am sure it is not required, the manager did not give her a ""welcome packet"" of any sort explaining benefits such as retirement accounts or healthcare. Management basically put her on an ambulance right away and started working her. According to GF, the management at her current job seems pretty clueless about the healthcare and benefits they offer. According to GF, manager told her the company pays 75% and employee pays the remaining 25% and the price of her insurance is based off her age. The insurance is through BCBS. What does this manager even mean? I'm assuming the manager is referring to GF's premium, the amount she pays out of pocket every two weeks? Apparantly, a coworker around GF's age pays $50 every two weeks. GF just informed me today that a coworker told her the deductible is like 2 or 3 thousand. She likes the job just cant afford to be without insurance in case of a catastrophic emergency. I have excellent insurance in my current job and it will only get better once I start my new job with the federal government. We are not yet married so she cant be on my insurance yet. How do we find out details on her employer sponsored healthcare plan? Call BCBS? If her healthcare coverage is as cruddy as it sounds, should we be looking for private insurance on healthcare.gov?

My university offers a student insurance program but the cost is about $1,300 per year which is probably pretty cheap for health care out of pocket, but I’m currently struggling just to pay tution, so I’m looking for other options. 

Someone brought up Medicaid but I’m unsure if it matters which state I apply for Medicaid in? Am I supposed to apply for Medicaid in my home state (which is where I last filed taxes) or am I supposed to apply in the state that I am attending Uni? Does it matter?

I have a feeling that I might not qualify for Medicaid, but I heard their marketplace for health insurance has cheap coverage options? Does anyone know what the price range might be if I purchased insurance from one of these options. 

If none of the marketplace options are cheaper, I might just have to purchase from my university.

I had insurance through the marketplace and 99% of my premiums were covered. I went through 3 surgeries and greatly benefited from my wonderful coverage.  All was well and everything worked out perfectly at the end of the year and tax time.  I am in North Carolina as reference, and medicaid was not expanded.  


I had renewed my insurance for 2019 and estimated to make the same amount, so everything ""should"" have worked out the same.  But, at the end of 2018 I had lost my job, and have struggled to find anything since.  It is now July and I have made $0 for the year (living off of family support and savings).    My huge concern is what will happen if I make less than the poverty line, or for example do not make anything at all.  Will I have to pay back the $600 a month in subsidies?  Should I cancel my insurance now to potentially save myself some money when that happens?  


I understand there is a good chunk of the year left and that I could potentially find a job and make the money that I need to.  I just want to be prepared in case that does not happen.    I have contacted the healthcare marketplace and they told me there is no information they can provide on their end, and that if any repayment was issued, it would be through the IRS.   Next, I called the IRS to try and get clarification, but did not seem to get a straight answer.  


Right now I see 3 possibilities:

1) I find a job and make 13k, and everything works out.

2)  I do not find a job or do not make enough by the end of the year to qualify for the subsidies.  Thus potentially having to pay back up to $7000.

3)  I claim self-employment of making 13k, and use my entire savings to pay the taxes (estimated $3500), to secure being penalized and paying back the full subsidies.  

&#x200B;

I have done a lot of research, and found forums with very similar situations.  Information that went both directions and it confused me even more.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

[News] How bad science led to an obesity epidemic,cbzi9s,"Seventeen years ago, in July of 2002, Gary Taubes broke what I thought was to be the biggest story of our time. All the advice we've been spoon-fed about counting calories, eating low fat, avoiding salt, all of it, was not based on any scientifically proven hypothesis. The dietary advice handed down from the food guidelines established by the US government, implemented in school lunch programs, hospitals, military and so forth was all based on a few white men from the East Coast’s theories. That right, none of it was tested in clinical trials and found to be true.

There is evidence that the Germans in pre-WWII had an understanding of how hormonal regulation influences our ability to fatten up or slim down, but that research was thrown out when we won the war and those men in charge of studying nutrition decided instead to cherry-pick data points that confirmed their preconceived predilections.

Now, we’re a nation of fat sick people.

We produce a show called Empowered Health, a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode about this research and history with the expert on the subject, Gary Taubes. Figured this subreddit may be interested in the episode. For those who don't know, he’s the author of Good Calories, Bad Calories; Why We Get Fat, The Case Against Sugar and others. Taubes is an investigative journalist who painstaking went through all the research and all the footnotes in all the research to determine what was valid advice and what’s garbage.

His reporting is compelling and I was sure he was about to change the world. But, he didn’t. Yes, the needle was nudged, but the scandal has hardly had the influence I would have expected given the massive impact it has on our lives.

“Nobody's trying to deceive you because they know the truth,” Taubes said. “They're trying to deceive you because they've already fooled themselves.”

"Belmont University College of Pharmacy and HealthTrust’s Evidence Based Clinical Management Fellow in Drug Information, recently became certified by examination in healthcare informatics.",8xvnw9,"Dr. Emily (Locke) Singleton, Belmont University College of Pharmacy and HealthTrust’s Evidence Based Clinical Management Fellow in Drug Information, recently became certified by examination in healthcare informatics. The Certified Associate in Healthcare Information and Management Systems (CAHIMS) is a new Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) health IT certification designed for emerging professionals within the industry.
This certification demonstrates knowledge of health IT and management systems, facilitates entry-level careers in health IT and is designed to be a career pathway to the Certified Professional in Healthcare Information and Management Systems (CPHIMS) credential.
“During my fourth year of pharmacy school, I worked alongside several HIMSS certified pharmacists. Just as their certifications have demonstrated their expertise to me, I look forward to distinguishing myself with the CAHIMS certification as I start my career as a pharmacist,"" said Singleton.
Belmont’s sponsor of the CAHIMS certification initiative is Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Anthony Blash, Pharm.D., BCompSc, CPHIMS. Dr. Blash has created a five-course sequence of classes to prepare Belmont student pharmacists for healthcare informatics and to sit for the CAHIMS certification. The college saw its first students certify at the CAHIMS level in 2015 and expects 20-30 students to certify each year moving forward. Blash has also been invited to teach a one day “Boot Camp,” which is an intensive version of the CAHIMS review at the Healthcare Summit of the Southeast, for HIMSS North America as a Virtual Class Leader and on the campus of Belmont University at the 2018 Health IT Certification Review Course.
“Nashville is considered by many to be home to the U.S. healthcare industry, with nearly 300 companies providing healthcare synergies found in few other places.” said Blash. “If your interests lie in healthcare and informatics, our program stands apart. With experiential rotation sites at the headquarters of the largest healthcare organizations in the world, faculty with experiences in the corporate boardrooms of America’s healthcare corporations and a pharmacy/healthcare informatics experience facilitated by the past national chairman of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ Educational Steering Committee on Informatics and Technology, our faculty represents the pinnacle of teaching experience. As a HIMSS Approved Education Partner, Belmont University’s College of Pharmacy becomes the only pharmacy school in the world with a healthcare informatics concentration leading to an internationally recognized certification in healthcare informatics which may be obtained before experiential rotations, residency inquiries and job searches begin.”",2018-07-11 15:48:28

I would like to work in healthcare IT & handle Information Systems. I don't want to deal with hardware, troubleshooting, I prefer more suit & tie based work vs. traditional IT / tech support.

Maybe what I'm trying to do is not really IT, I'm not sure. I'm looking to handle electronic medical records, data, systems, compliance, privacy officer, analyst, type of positions. What certifications do I need? What type of experienced should I be going for? I'm enrolled in a masters program in health informatics and i have 2 years medical records tech experience. I'm taking the compTIA A+ 220-902. Then I'll go for the network+ & security+. I'm also going for RHIA (something big for healthcare). I'm looking to do IT/IS in a healthcare context.

Ophthalmology PACS,8s99rj,"Hi everyone,

Im a pretty seasoned healthcare systems admin with over 10 years of PACS experience. Last year I accepted a position with a new hospital to assist with an ophthalmology PACS implementation. I thought Id walk in there and knock it out of the park but man was I wrong. From what Ive seen, no single PACS vendor will be able to accept images from all vendors and view them natively. The recommend method for viewing images seems to create a structured report with selected images in those reports and then export them to your PACS. This way, you're basically simply exporting a PDF vs exporting the exam. There doesnt seem to be any push to have these various PACS systems interpret reference lines, reconstructions, etc. OCTs seem to be the biggest hurdle in my area. We are currently using Merge Eye Care PACS but Ive heard these same problems are prevalent in HEYEX by Heidelberg, Forum by Zeiss, and a few others Ive researched.

My questions is, does anyone have any experience with PACS in ophthalmology? If so, what system do you use? Do you get everything you need to make a good interpretation from the format presented by your PACS or do you feel that it falls short (if so, how). I feel this is such a niche group of systems that very few of my colleagues have any experience so I was hoping some of you good folks would have some insight. 

The PACS system is live and being used. We are integrated with Epic and are moving forward with some HL7 integration soon. I just want to know is there something I can do to make this thing act more like a traditional PACS and not some glorified report viewer.",2018-06-20 03:56:04

**Consent Form**

Oscar Insurance Corporation

In this Consent Form, you can choose whether to allow Oscar Insurance Corporation (“Oscar”) to obtain access to your medical records through a computer network operated by Healthix Inc. (“Healthix”), which is part of a statewide computer network.

You may use this Consent Form to decide whether or not to allow Oscar to see and obtain access to your electronic health records in this way. You can give consent or deny consent, and this form may be filled out now or at a later date. Your choice will not affect your ability to get medical care or health insurance coverage. Your choice to give or to deny consent may not be the basis for denial of health services.

Do you think the VA should go with Cerner or keep developing VistaA?,8gd4ta,"I wonder what other people think about this issue. I think it's been interesting hearing that the VA was gonna adopt cerner, got cold feet hearing the price (10 billion to just implement but not to maintain and run the system), then the firing of Shulkin, and many other twists and turns I'm not mentioning. As far as I know, no final decision has been made either.

**I'm curious to hear what other people think. Should the VA outsource it's EHR to Cerner (at whatever cost that will end up at) or should they put their effort into improving VistaA?**

-----------------

My personal opinion: I think it would be an incorrect and unnecessary move to adopt Cerner given the current circumstances for the following reasons.  

- I think 10 billion is way too expensive to just simply implement the system, and it seems that further cost would be spent running the system and even then the VA would be unable to simply turn off Vista anyway. So essentially you'd be forced to run at least two systems.

- Even more than that, I truly think that the world could benefit from a somewhat decent and open source EHR (Vista is open source). 

- Furthermore, as someone that has used Vista I really don't think it's THAT bad. It's not great. It's incredibly ugly, but it's actually fairly functional. I think some very basic improvements could vastly improve the quality with very little actual change to the

PMR’s study estimates the market to increase from revenues worth US$ 5,216.1 Mn in 2017 to reach US$ 9,162.2 Mn by 2025-end.

Asia Pacific (APAC) will continue to be the most lucrative region in the global animal health active pharmaceutical ingredient market, with sales exhibiting the second highest CAGR through 2025. APAC has remained one of the largest API suppliers, at affordable costs. Governments across APAC have been making investments and focusing on local manufacturing facilities of APIs. Favorable policies offered by these governments have been shifting the focus of API manufacturers in moving their production bases to APAC countries, such as India and China. In addition, limited insurance or government intervention provides smooth flow to market growth in these regions.

However, animal health API products manufactured in APAC countries do not meet regulatory standards, and there has been increasing concerns pertaining to the quality of APIs, especially those produced in China and India. Western regulatory bodies are becoming stricter in the inspection of APIs produced in these regions. Manufacturers are further facing challenges in bridging the gap between the cost and quality of APIs. These factors will inhibit growth of the market in APAC.
Europe will remain the second largest market for animal health active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Clinical Image workflow suggestions.,74g9at,"I’m wondering how other organizations handle clinical images.  We have two options that we use, both with issues.  One option is to use the OnBase Mobile app to take pictures on an iPod which are then uploaded into OnBase and then linked to the chart.  The issue with this workflow is it’s slow and cumbersome. In a scenario such as wound care and dermatology where several photos are taken, the time it takes to index each picture and wait for the upload doesn’t work with a short office visit. The other option we just began to implement is the use of tethered photography.  A USB connects from the camera to an encrypted computer so all pictures taken bypass the camera storage and are stored on the network where they are then indexed in OnBase. This works really well with the exception of a USB cable being dragged around the exam room where there are usually multiple providers.  Looking further I found the USB2AIR device which essentially makes the USB wireless.  Perfect until we looked into the security protocols used in the transfer and found is uses WEP encryption which is making out security team squirm. We are an Epic shop and plan to implement Haiku/Canto in the future, but I’ve been tasked with providing an interim solution. ",2017-10-06 03:50:54

Do you use NFC\RFID to unlock windows machines?,6ez89m,"About 4 years ago I thought a fingerprint reader would be a bonus way to accommodate staff complaining about the time required to enter passwords each time they had to unlock their machines.  However, we had a mandatory industry standard of requiring that passwords are changed every 90 days.  By the time 3 months rolled around staff had forgotten their existing password so couldn't reset it.  Has your organization implemented ""what you are"" (biometrics) or ""what you have"" (fob, badges, etc) types of authentication methods vs. ""what you know"" (passwords)?  How do they handle the fact that passwords are still the foundation of these types of accounts?  Have they completely relaxed the standards around scheduled password changes?

I would love to find a secure, stable, foolproof, (read this won't blow up in my face requiring scads of time) way to bypass staff entering passwords each time.

I do not have much experience with coding but would be willing to learn what is required. If I did go this route, I would like to focus my studies on what is required by the companies instead of trying to learn to code in a language that I might not use.


I believe my years in the military have helped me gain a lot of valuable leadership experience as well as help me advance into roles beyond clinical nursing.

I would just like to know of specific ways to make inroads with EMR or other healthcare companies and if my current experience is sufficient to serve in the above mentioned roles.

If possible, can you provide some companies with expertise in this field so I can start to research and see if I match with their needs.

Thank you.",2016-02-06 02:35:53

 I've recently made the decision to look into a career working in healthcare IT. I have a BS in biology/premed and with a passion for computers (although I have no coding experience). I have been working for the past three years as a clinical information manager, which is a glorified title for an emergency room scribe, but this experience has made me very proficient in cerner and edims. I have the medical side of the field down for sure, but I'm worried about the IT part. Due to my fiance's career, we are unsure where we will be living in the next few years, so an online degree is my best bet. Anyone have any experience taking these courses online with no IT background?

Looking for standalone DMWL testing tool,2gq994,"Hi, 

I'm need to test the Dicom Modality Worklist being provided by a imaging server.  I only have the server itself to run this tool on, and as the customer is very remote to my location, I'm not able to go onsite to test the DMWL with a laptop or other device.
  
The key features that I'm after are: 
* The ability to masquerade as a different IP address and AE title
* Zero foot-print  i.e. a portable / no install tool as this will be run on the server itself. 

I've looked at the DICOM emulator from dvt.org, but it doesn't seem to suit as 

a) it has to be installed and 

b) it doesn't appear that I can masquerade the IP address to appear to the DMWL that the emulator is one of the modalities already configured. 

Is there such a tool?

Technical training for PMs,12y0o4,"I am part of a small, project management group at a HIE.

TED talk: Designing health products that empower patients to self-manage their chronic illnesses.,14pdrn,,2012-12-12 16:48:54
A rant from a lone physician,1foi6j,"I've become incredibly frustrated by the many varying EMRs that I've had the displeasure to interact with.  McKesson's Physician Portal, Citrix, Epic - all of them have felt cumbersome, difficult to learn, and end up taking what would have been a 5 minute patient interaction and stretched it out to 30min of tab checking, box clicking.  Not to mention they seem to take pleasure in burying important information, highlighting other things as critical when they clearly arent (i.e. K+ 3.4 ..low end of normal at my institution is considered 3.5) etc etc

I'm left to wonder whether any physicans were involved from the onset of development of an EHR or if they are consulted as an after thought.

I want to find an application that lets me log into my hospitals EMR, be beautiful / a joy to use *gasp..*.   Try not to roll your eyes just yet.  I figure if an EMR can conjure of the most guttural of hate, it can also elevate the users experience to joy.  

I saw a video about the Ottawa Hospital using iPad based EMR solution from Adaptiv.  I wish I could use something like that.  Easy. Beautiful. Simple. Allowing me to spend more time engaging the patient and less time clicking check boxes.  Why dont more systems look like that? Or what about the Nightingale design demo? I want data that I can interact with.  I want to take fixed data points like BP or temperature and quickly be able to look for trends or patterns..

If such an EMR exists - please educate me.  Point me in its direction.

As an aside, I know that this forum has very little love for the iPad and mobile devices.  That said, when I look around my hospital, 70%+ of physicians carry a cell phone and iPad - with a majority of the cell phone users having an iPhone.  We like to check in on our patients on the fly, from the comfort of a device we as a profession clearly favor - build us something that we can rush to support...rather than dragging us into your camp kicking and screaming

Privacy Screen Recommendations?,1ecen2,"So JCAHO wants us to have privacy screens on all nurse's station computers in the hospital. We use something like [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Yd-QA9NsL._SX385_.jpg) except for regular monitors.

Similar to the image, ours have these irritating ""tabs"" that are supposed to hold the screen in place, but really it just causes it to bow causing a small space at the top between the screen and monitor.

This causes the text to appear blurry unless you are *directly* in front of the screen. If you push the screen flat it works like it's supposed to, but what ends up happening is doctors and nurses just take them off and set them behind the monitors.

Does anybody else have this problem? What do you all do?",2013-05-15 11:56:45

"Picking an EHR system?  Avoid CPSI, imo. ",1b6a3m,"I have been the IT director for 3 different hospitals over the past 10 years. I've worked with McKesson, HMS and now CPSI. 

CPSI has been the absolute worst system I've ever seen. Here's an example of CPSI's approach to new features. 

CPSI uses something called UBL mgmt to manage user accounts. About 4 months ago, they added 2 shiny new buttons, LOCK and UNLOCK to allow locking and unlocking user accounts. The buttons are lit and fully usable. When clicked, they pop up a box that prompts, ""Are you Sure?"" w/ Yes/No buttons. 

Great. the problem?

These buttons DONT actually do anything. The functionality behind them is being rolled out in a future patch. CPSI thought it was a great idea to add the buttons, enable the buttons and even imply functionality with the popups, but in reality, they do nothing. 

So, for the past 3 months, my I.S. team has been locking the accounts of termed users. Yesterday, I find out these buttons do absolutely nothing.

Today, I get to go thru *ALL* terms for the past 3-4 months and actually disable them. Had a termed user realized that their account was still active and gotten into the system, I'm POSITIVE, CPSI would have apologized, shrugged and went on with their day. The cleanup and bullets-to-be-taken would have been all mine. 

I feel this is indicative of a majority of their work on the software. This exact kind of crap. 

If you love frustrating issues like this, then I highly recommend CPSI. If you would prefer to spend your time actually managing IT in a hospital, instead of chasing your tail, then I suggest something else. ",2013-03-29 02:25:48

Trying to get in to the Epidemiology or Clinical research field,7fmr3y,"I am applying for MPH programs with the intent to go in to one of the above fields. However, I am working full time as an IV room pharmacy technician at a prestigious hospital and would prefer an online program. There seems to be many online from accredited institutions.

I was just wondering if an online MPH program is worth it or if anyone has a better idea on how to break in to these fields. 

More on my background: I have a bachelors degree in environmental science with a minor in geospatial technologies and was a student volunteer at the EPA in the toxicology department.

Finding my way in Public Health,7fhqjv,"I may have posted here before not exactly sure but, the thing is I’ve began my journey into the field of public health. I got my undergraduate degree in Health Care Management. I really liked the concept about learning about a health care setting and improving systems. Which lead me to public health it just seemed more exciting than just management. This is actually my first semester in grad school and it has been so difficult and stressful. I came in with my focus being Epidemiology but after this intro class I’m strongly considering. With the material I really feel like I have to work 3 times as hard and fast to catch up to the class. I don’t want my entires career to be like that. I struggle with statistics and it’s a miracle I somehow pass. Any who, I’ve decided to switch to Community Oriented Primary Care. I’m excited because it seems I will be dealing more with people and the community up front. My goal is to make sure programs are created and accessible to high risk communities. I know the job doesn’t sound as exciting as Epidemiology and I know I won’t even get paid as much. But this is where my passion lies and I feel I can really make a difference. I hope I can be great.

The potential health impact on a population of legislating the need for a 'bicycle license' test,71mcrv,"Hi everyone

So I read in the paper today that the UK government is considering brining in legislation to force cyclists to need a 'licence' to cycle given the increasing number of pedestrians killed by cyclists each year. 

I was just wondering on the expert public health view on how you would start to formulate an equation to weigh up the potential health benefits of killing fewer pedestrians on our streets vs the disbenefit to discouraging people to cycle and reduce their risk of heart disease etc. 

How would do this when the risks and benefits sit with different people in the population? And how does their 'propensity' for discouragement relate to the potential impact on their health etc. i.e are infrequent cyclists likely to be discouraged more quickly and so the disbenefit to their health is larger / smaller etc.?

Your thoughts on this interesting question is very much appreciated!",2017-09-22 10:53:40

How to break into the field,6mvf69,"Hello all. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's of Science degree in Public Health. I want to be an epidemiologist, but am not planning on starting a master's program until next year. As of now I'm looking to break into the field in any way I can. I am looking for an entry level public health job but have not had any luck so far. I have applied for positions such as community health, health education, global health, public sanitarian, research, etc.  but have not received any calls for interviews yet.

As of now I am working a seasonal job. Any suggestions or tips would be appreciated. 

I should also add that I am located in Michigan (closest major city is Flint).  I interned at a Health Department before graduating but have not heard of any job openings there. I am a veteran, but have no prior work experience in public health.

Question about Master's in Public Health vs Epi,663cq6,"Hello all. This is my first post on reddit and it looks like you all can be very helpful. I am writing on behalf of my husband as he is currently busy with our six month old daughter. 

He is about to graduate from the University of Michigan-Flint campus with a Bachelor's degree in Public Health. His goal is to become an Epidemiologist, and is looking into Michigan State's Master's of Public Health program as it seems to be able to completed all online. However, their Epidemiology Master's Program is not all online and would likely require us to move closer to that area. 

My question is how important it is to have a Master's in Epi vs Public Health if his goal is to be an Epidemiologist. He would rather do the Public Health program, but not if it means he will have trouble finding a job once he is finished. 

Also, if anyone has any suggestions on finding Public Health jobs using a Bachelor's degree that would be appreciated as well. We are currently located in Holly, Michigan. I will be graduating with the same degree but have a few more semesters to go. He just got done interning at the local Health Department which he really enjoyed, but hasn't had any job leads yet. 

I am extremely proud of him for working his butt off while going to school for three years straight, including spring and summer after getting out of the Marine Corps in 2013. 

Thank you all for your time, and we look forward to reading any and all responses.

The hospital, which opened in March 2015, is located on the property of Ashan Children's Home, an orphanage. Besides treating the orphans, the hospital is also open to the surrounding community. The problem is that this hospital does not have access to enough of the proper medical equipment such as beds, bandages, syringes, sanitation supplies, and the list goes on. As soon-to-be nurses attending Bellevue College, we feel a great opportunity and obligation to make sure that people in the community surrounding Ashan get the proper healthcare that they need.

The hope is to build a strong relationship with the hospital to be able to send 6th quarter student over to Ghana for their senior practicum!

What should we expect from academic global health leaders?,b6w2xi,"This [thread](https://twitter.com/AndrewMakeTweet/status/1111392459333029889) about comments from Harvard's director of their global health institute highlights a really prominent leader's inadequate concern for the consequences of working with partners who are generally causing harm. I think everyone should be fluent in the [non-profit industrial complex](https://incite-national.org/beyond-the-non-profit-industrial-complex/) and this seems like the academic version of that. This also seems to dovetail with 'neoliberal'/marketization and 'austerity' ideologies that don't empirically work and definitely cause global health harm. I don't know Professor Jha and don't mean for this to be a critique of him personally, but I think there are important questions we should wrestle with regarding how these leaders use their prominence, and global health's good, to the benefit of harmful individuals, corporations, and governments. For governments, I think about recent critiques of Partners in Health (which I generally quite admire!) in Rwanda as its leader has done a lot of good but also has been quite authoritarian and violent.

Anyway, curious for this community's thoughts.",2019-03-30 00:55:48

I thought about what Sara wrote, and I asked myself, ""Would you have lived your own life differently if you had never had to worry about health insurance?""   The answer actually surprised me.  The truth is, yes, I believe I would have, particularly after having my first child (in 1991).  When I lost my high-tech job in 2002 during the ""dot-com bubble bust"" (something I was virtually certain would never happen to me ... heck, I had published a Linux book that same year), I worked for a couple of years as an independent contractor.  It paid well, contract work wasn't terribly difficult to find; but I lived in terror of not being able to find a full-time permanent job with a company that provided group health insurance a s benefit.  My wife had those famous ""pre-existing conditions"" (a colon cancer in 2000).  I understood full-well, for the first time in my life that I was not special ... I was not immune to the two life-changing events that, together, are the cause of 75% of American bankruptcies:  1) a sudden loss of income and 2) a catastrophic medical emergency.  I vowed that would never happen to me, or to my family.  We immigrated to Canada in 2005, when I was 48 years old, already well past the age when most people make such a huge life change.  It turned out to be the best and wisest decision I've ever made.

In thinking back on those dark days, I realized that I certainly am one of those people Sara Robinson spoke of, who made a major life decision based on a worry about health care. And I wasn't even a young man at the time. For young people, who aren't yet worrying about old-age income security; not having to worry about health care must be very liberating. It should be.",2018-01-14 02:32:47

Canada's Socialized Medicine (and my experience with it),7ork0d,"A statistic that has been cited often to me when comparing the US and Canadian heath care systems is the number of MRI machines per million people ... and the US has roughly four times as many MRI machines (per million people) as Canada. ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282401/density-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-units-by-country/))

Could Canada use more MRI machines?  Oh, absolutely, but the number of MRI facilities is not an indicator of the health of a population.  If anything, I believe, the proliferation of private for-profit MRI clinics in the US represents a mis-allocation of resources ... the money goes where the highest profit can be earned; not where the real need is.

It is important to understand that, in Canada, the only people who are allowed to make decisions about who receives medical care are physicians.  In the United States, by contract, HMOs and other private medical insurers do indeed make many such decisions about who gets what care (it's probably more appropriate to say ""who gets *denied* the care they need""). In Canada, medical decisions are left entirely up to doctors, and there are no requirements for pre-authorization whatsoever.   If your family doctor says you need an MRI, you get an MRI.  Like I did after a severe concussion four years ago.  An emergency room doctor called a Moncton New Brunswick hospital, and I got an immediate appointment for an MRI the following morning.  Straight to the head of the line. My ""ability to pay"" was not a consideration. In the US, if an insurance administrator or HMO rep says you are not getting an MRI, then you're not getting one regardless of what your doctor thinks — unless, of course, you pay for it out of your own pocket.  I bet you there are far more Americans paying for necessary medical procedures out of their own pockets than there Canadians who find it necessary to do that.

If the number of MRI units, proportionally, to the population is not a good measure of the general health care of that population, then what is?

There are statistics that are generally accepted as valid measure of the overall health of a population.  What are some of these and, in the aggregate, which fairs better by these measures, the US or Canada?

 

**Infant mortality rates (the number of children, per thousand who were born live, who die within their first year of life)**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate#Under-five_mortality_from_the_World_Health_Organization

**The probability of a newborn making it to age 65**
http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_pro_of_rea_65_mal-health-probability-reaching-65-male

**Life expectancy at birth for the total population (male and female), considered a good indicator of overall health**
(The gap in life expectancy between Canada and the United States continues to widen.)

**And, my own favourite statistic: expected number of healthy years of life**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy


Detractors of the Canadian health care system should be especially careful because individual horror cases abound in the US health care system (people financially ruined, refused necessary treatment, people who die from an inability to pay for necessary medical care). Individual horror cases with medical care can be found in either the US or Canada, and prove nothing, but I would like to share a personal horror story.  This proves nothing, but it was my experience, and I know I was not the only one.

My daughter was born in February 1991.  A few months later, we got an bill for around $3600 from the hospital.  When I said we had insurance (with Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Alabama), they said, ""Your insurance company doesn't want to pay ... they are challenging some of the charges.""  I was livid.  I contacted BCBS and they gave me the song and dance.  It took over 6 months for them to eventually pay, and the hospital collections office was hounding me, calling me frequently at my workplace.  It was embarrassing and it was infuriating.  I was talking to one person or another at BCBS; essentially getting the run-around. I threatened at one point to turn the matter over to a lawyer.  It was a major hassle, but when they eventually paid the claim in full, I understood that it was *never* their intention *not to pay* ... they just wanted to delay that payment as long as possible.  They made me fight for it.

In other words, they played a twisted game with me and with my family.  And we did nothing to deserve that kind of treatment.

Canada's single-payer universal system of health care is, without a doubt, the uppermost reason I am very glad I moved my family to Canada (we became citizens of Canada, as a family, in 2012)

[x-post] Healthcare in Russia,7bdwy7,"I co-host a podcast called [She's In Russia](http://shesinrussia.com/) and this week's episode is all about the Russian healthcare system since the fall of the Soviet Union.

It was a fun topic to do, cause the Russian constitution guarantees the right to free healthcare, but obviously in practice things work a little differently.

Also, one of our friends comes on and tell her tale of going to a hospital in St. Petersburg and being told to shit in what essentially amounts to a flower pot.

countries with most liberal pharmaceutical regulations,6yp6ki,"I know that under the WTO's TRIPS agreement, countries designated by the U.N. as a Least Developed Country (LDC) have great leeway in use of generic pharmaceuticals.

As a U.S. citizen who has traveled widely, I have personally experienced the freedom of access to pharmaceuticals (for good and ill) in other countries.  

When I was in Tibet, pharmacies were wooden stands -- they reminded me of seasonal fireworks stands in the U.S. that you see at the end of June -- but you could buy practically anything you wanted as long as you had cash.  (It was also in Tibet in which I saw a goat wandering the halls of a hospital, and had to go to a medical warehouse to buy isopropyl alcohol, which had to be placed in a donated Medicins Sans Frontieres glass IV bottle, as there was no suitable container for the alcohol: it was stored in bulk, in a steel drum.) 

When I lived in Peru for a time, I also found it much easier to get pharmaceuticals -- as compared to the U.S., where access is gated by your primary care physician, your health insurance, etc.  For example, in the U.S., if you have a chronic health condition and you know what medication you need (e.g., an inhaler for asthma), you will need a current prescription, which may require a primary care visit, and financial charges for that, etc.  Such restrictions understandably can breed resentment for most Americans (78% who  live paycheck-to-paycheck, most of whom cannot afford a $400 emergency expense, many of whom have less than $1,000 in savings, etc.)  

Of course there are significant downsides to liberal access to pharmaceuticals, but the countries with liberal approaches to pharmaceutical regulation usually are countries with limited health system infrastructure: when a society cannot provide clinicians, it may try to mitigate the impact of this by providing easy and inexpensive access to medications.

My question: outside of the list of Least Developed Countries, is there a list of countries known for liberal pharmaceutical regulation?  

For example, I know that India and Bangladesh are both known for great flexibility when it comes to pharmaceutical access.  What are some others?",2017-09-08 08:11:15

Jobs in global health/public health that are not primarily desk/computer jobs,6pu1n9,"As I'm entering the field of global and public health, I'm trying to find my ""niche"" that supports both my interests and what will make me happy on a day-to-day basis. I'm currently a Global Health Corps fellow placed in Uganda, and, reflecting how I felt with my job previous to the fellowship, I REALLY do not like desk jobs/computer work/office situations. My best days are when I'm out in the field, and my worst are the days when I'm sitting behind a computer or in an office for eight hours. I always feel so miserable tired and unhappy at the end of the day, and I am naturally an energetic person so I feel very anxious and unsatisfied.

It seems like a lot of jobs that I've found in public and global health are mostly based behind a computer or at a desk, and I'm trying to find a niche that allows me for a lot of interpersonal interaction and being out on the field. I've considered going into public health nursing or health education, but the thing is that I really really care about making a wider impact on large global and public health issues, on say a policy or programming level, so I feel that pursuing a career like nursing or health ed might make me feel limited/unsatisfied as I will be only working with smaller populations and not creating such a substantial systemic impact that I would like to work towards.

Anyways, **TL;DR**: I am searching for opportunities in global/public health that provide opportunities for large impact on major health issues, that do not require me to be behind a desk or computer the majority of the time. Does anyone have any insight on what sort of careers to seek for?

Side note, I only have my bachelor's degree, so I plan on pursuing either a post-bac or MPH degree sometime within the next two years so I'm also trying to figure out which higher education path will match my personal interests and professional needs.",2017-07-27 19:32:23

Medical Student looking for research projects,64mrev,"Hi all,

I am a 3rd year medical student based in NYC, and I am looking for research projects to do as part of our required research concentration. The total research period is 3 months, though 1 of those 3 months is taking a class on global health in either ""public health and communicable diseases"" or ""acute care and surgical needs."" I would of course plan on continuing to work beyond those 3 months, as I assume that the project will need it.

I have a lot of experience in various research projects domestically, and I've done two medically-oriented trips abroad (once in two cities in India for hematology/oncology rotations, and once in Accra, Ghana for Emergency Medicine and Toxicology which yielded two posters).

Do any of you guys have any particular leads? I am strongly interested in emergency medicine, public health, and infrastructure/operations. I am also, naturally, very interested in a 
future career in international medicine. I speak moderate Spanish, for what that helps (I can run a patient encounter on my own). In addition to options in South America, I would also be interested in working in Southeast Asia.

Thank you for any help or direction that you can give me!",2017-04-11 11:40:53

I work full-time right now and I definitely do want to go back to graduate school eventually, but I'm not in a place of my life right now to do so, so ATM pursuing a MPH with a focus on M&E isn't really an option for at least a couple of years.

EDIT: I should note, I have my BA in International Relations with a minor in health promotion so I'm not using this to substitute for a degree.

Help me give £5000 worth of prize money away to one of the world's leading effective charities just by clicking vote!,5esup8,"VOTE: http://www.asos.com/discover/students/asos-on-campus/blank-canvas-competition#/MarcusSim

So I've been shortlisted as one of 200 finalists in ASOS's Blank Canvas Competition, the prize money of which is £5000 (or £1000 for 2nd-5th place)!

I am really keen to donate that money to the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) to buy long-lasting insecticidal nets but I really am not going to win without your votes (the leading design is over 4000 votes ahead!). The AMF is one of the most cost-effective, high impact and evidence-based charities, and is highly transparent. This is important because malaria is one of the leading killers of children under 5. Interestingly, mosquitos are also the only animal that causes the death of more humans than humans ourselves. 

I know coming close to winning at all is extremely unlikely, but if you're up for one hell of a long shot, and making one hell of a difference*, please do take (literally) 5 seconds to vote!

*£5000 could protect 3749 people from malaria for three to four years (see www.givewell.org or www.thelifeyoucansave.org for more info)

Also my donor history page where you can check for proof of me donating it should I receive the prize money (current donations are 100% of profits from my Redbubble store online):

Any former GHC fellows or someone with similar experience care to review my application?,5du40c,"I recognize that the GHC is rather competitive so my chances of getting accepted aren't that high since I don't have a ton of experience, but I want to try anyways because why not?

If anyone who has been a fellow for Global Health Corps or something similar would be willing to review my two of my statements I would greatly appreciate it! I'm still working on the other two but I think getting feedback for the first two will help me craft my other answers.

Note: I'm assuming someone will probably bring this up so I know that the Peace Corps is another less competitive option for GHC, but I was denied medical clearance once and while I do plan on applying again I have unique health issues that the PC has told me multiple times before that they might have difficulties accommodating for me. So this is just another option for me.

**1. Why do you want to be a GHC fellow?**

I am interested in being a GHC fellow because I believe it is the perfect opportunity into the world of global health, and because I believe I can contribute a unique perspective and positive energy to whichever organization I am placed in. I am incredibly passionate about global health and see myself working in this realm in the future. I eventually want to go into global health program design or monitoring and evaluation, and the GHC will provide me with tangible, real-life experience that I can carry with me for the rest of my life. I am also particularly interested in health equity in the developing world, as I have seen the inequalities first hand and I recognize it is an injustice that where you are born almost always defines your personal health. I firmly believe in equitable health access for all, and being a GHC fellow will give me the opportunity to turn my passion into a reality.

**2. Tell us about a time when you were part of a group that faced an obstacle and you came up with a creative solution. What was creative about this solution? Please focus on your role and the outcome.**

I was deployed on a humanitarian disaster response mission with the Red Cross in September 2016 with little context as to what the disaster was. I was sent to the California/Mexico border to face a unique situation: there was a massive influx of Haitian entrants at the Mexico/California border, and we had been assigned to set up a shelter for them. My team and I were in charge of setting up two shelters, with almost no support from the California government, as it was during election season and the topic of refugees was very sensitive. Initially we had no outside organizations supporting us and it was our duty to figure out how to efficiently shelter and take care of the over 300 entrants that we were supporting. Using my limited proficiency in French and with a coworkers Spanish, we were able to communicate with some of the Haitian entrants to learn enough about the Haitian community in California to begin harnessing community connections. We reached out to several organizations that were connected to the Haitian community, which helped secure us a source of food. Using only the shelter training I had received through the Red Cross, I helped set up a check-in and tracking system for the shelter inhabitants, as well as shelter rules, expectations, and day-to-day schedules to ensure the health and safety of the occupants. We were able to successfully run the two shelters until word spread and other nonprofits stepped in with enough monetary donations to help resettle the entrants.",2016-11-20 09:07:51

In light of recently world events and natural disasters, as well as my own interests, I want to start looking into programs that help with international disaster relief. I've heard lots of good things about programs like Team Rubicon, Doctors Without Borders and others. However, I wouldn't know where to look to check out their cred, ya feel? To see if they, and other programs like them, are legit or not.

As the title states, I am only an EMT-B (in Maryland, but I just moved to Arizona and am about to schedule my reciprocity/refresher course). I doubt this is a high enough medical certification to get seriously involved in these types of groups, whether for career or volunteer. Paramedic certification has been a goal of mine (once I save up the funds, that is), but what medical certifications would you guys recommend for this kind of work? Which ones are in most demand?

$12.9 Billion pledged for 2017-2019 at the Fifth Replenishment of the Global Fund,54ktms,"Hi All,

when I checked earlier, I didn't see this, so apologies if it gets double-posted accidentally.


Earlier this month, the Government of Canada hosted the [Fifth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria](http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2016-09-17_Global_Fund_Donors_Pledge_Nearly_$13_Billion_to_Help_End_Epidemics/). For those less familiar, the Global Fund is a financing initiative, created in 2002, which calls on donors from across sectors to help in the global fight to end the HIV, TB, and malaria epidemics, and disburses funds to support projects. At the Fifth Replenishment Conference, governments and organisations from around the globe made pledges amounting to $12.9 Billion, with the US, UK, and France making the largest commitments.


Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the region historically hit hardest by HIV, TB, and malaria, also made pledges, with some joining in the effort for the first time. Also outstanding was the contribution of the private sector, which doubled its commitment compared to the last Replenishment in 2013.


The Fifth Replenishment will support initiatives that will save an estimated 8 million lives between 2017 and 2019, adding to the 22 million who will have been saved by the end of 2016, and averting 300 million new infections.",2016-09-27 03:55:33

The Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI) seeks a media engagement volunteer/intern,52vnia,"Volunteer/Intern Position: Media Engagement on Global Catastrophic Risk

http://gcrinstitute.org/volunteerintern-position-media-engagement-on-global-catastrophic-risk/

The Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI) seeks a volunteer/intern to contribute on the topic of media engagement on global catastrophic risk, which is the risk of events that could harm or destroy global human civilization. The work would include two parts: (1) analysis of existing media coverage of global catastrophic risk and (2) formulation of strategy for media engagement by GCRI and our colleagues. The intern may also have opportunities to get involved in other aspects of GCRI.

All aspects of global catastrophic risk would be covered. Emphasis would be placed on GCRI’s areas of focus, including nuclear war and artificial intelligence. Additional emphasis could be placed on topics of personal interest to the intern, potentially including (but not limited to) climate change, other global environmental threats, pandemics, biotechnology risks, asteroid collision, etc.

The ideal candidate is a student or early-career professional seeking a career at the intersection of global catastrophic risk and the media. Career directions could include journalism, public relations, advertising, or academic research in related social science disciplines. Candidates seeking other career directions would also be considered, especially if they see value in media experience. However, we have a strong preference for candidates intending a career on global catastrophic risk.

The position is unpaid. The intern would receive opportunities for professional development, networking, and publication. GCRI is keen to see the intern benefit professionally from this position and will work with the intern to ensure that this happens. This is not a menial labor activity, but instead is one that offers many opportunities for enrichment.

A commitment of at least 10 hours per month is expected. Preference will be given to candidates able to make a larger time commitment. The position will begin during August-September 2016. The position will run for three months and may be extended pending satisfactory performance.

The position has no geographic constraint. The intern can work from anywhere in the world. GCRI has some preference for candidates from American time zones, but we regularly work with people from around the world. GCRI cannot provide any relocation assistance.

Candidates from underrepresented demographic groups are especially encouraged to apply.

Applications will be considered on an ongoing basis until 30 September, 2016.

To apply, please send the following to Robert de Neufville (robert [at] gcrinstitute.org):

* A cover letter introducing yourself and explaining your interest in the position. Please include a description of your intended career direction and how it would benefit from media experience on global catastrophic risk. Please also describe the time commitment you would be able to make.

* A resume or curriculum vitae.

* A writing sample (optional).",2016-09-16 00:45:54

Research on mental health of immigrant children to the West,51vsxk,"From Oslo, Norway, Northern Europe, here. Layperson. 

This is a complicated issue, with possibly many reasons behind the problems, including social. For fear of being called racist, and perhaps for lack of funding? there isn´t that much research on this subject.

I have asked researchers on effects of weapons on health and they said no, there is no such research.
And of course the reasons for the problems I talk of here might have nothing to do with weapons. 

Definitely I don´t say that Norwegian children are healthier, but they have a bit different health issues. Each nationality seems to have their own special style of problems.
There are so many children of immigrants in Oslo who need special attention at school.

In general in medicine I will say that there is a lack of study on problems that are not very easily defined, the vague and just a bit different from ""normal"". However, the teachers have to deal with these children. Usually when an immigrant child is difficult or having learning disabilities, the explanations are: parents are hopeless and uneducated, they are in a difficult situation with post traumatic stress disorder after fleeing from war, or they live too cramped, the parents are closely related. 
All these reasons might well often be true.

And obviously: Most of the children are healthy and happy. 

However: Could there be something more? 

Somali children have a five times higher rate of autism than the local children. It seems the Somali children in Somalia doesn´t have this problem. I have never seen a Somali child with something I would say resemble aspergers. I have seen many Somali children who have no language and cannot walk. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106569  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20964674

I can only find ten articles in pubmed when I search for somali and autism. 

The Somali children are very obvious because they are so terribly ill. Less obvious is:
The women from Sri Lanka who have miscarriage, one after another. No research that I can find. Even many men from Sri Lanka doesn´t know this has been happening, because it is so private and embarrassing. I don´t know if it is still happening.

The children from Iraq and Eritrea who are unconcentrated and hyper (the latter) or aggressive (the former). Aggressive and hyperactive  children from Serbia, now they are in their twenties, and it seems the next generation is OK. In Iraq itself there is an increase in cancer in children, the speculation is that the bombings are to blame. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20717542

It would mean so much if someone could do some research on this. The less clear-cut yet very problematic illness.",2016-09-09 18:50:45

Would you find this to fit into a GlobalHealth program? Any feedback that could be given? We would like to expand more on this, and some initial opinions could be really helpful, as we don't have that much medical knowledge ourselves.

Seeking insight on an MD/PhD in medical anthropology,4aat3o,"I am applying to medical school now and I am looking into pursuing an MD/PhD in a global health related field. One of the biggest reasons that I am interested in global health is the interdisciplinary nature of the field. How, in order to find solutions you need to not only understand medicine/biology, but also culture, society, history, and more.

This has led me to consider also an MD/PhD in medical anthropology. Does anyone on here have any insight on this type of dual degree. What type of research is done during the PhD portion? What type of career path does one usually follow after the degree? What opportunities does the degree provide. What are the pros and cons? 

And lastly, what are the main differences between studying medical anthropology and global health?

(See links below)

http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&num=13135

To summarise, it would appear that the quality of state-run healthcare and hospitals is so poor across the country that there has been a mass exodus of doctors from public hospitals, who have since taken to illegally running their own practices from home. Many of these doctors have become well-known for their proficiency and as a result, many North Korean citizens are opting to pay illicitly for prescriptions etc knowing that they will receive better quality of care. It is also the case that retired doctors have taken to doing the same thing with equal success.

My question is whether anyone is aware of similar such cases going on in other countries?

Many thanks.",2016-01-19 07:37:02

Benefits of speaking Spanish as an ER doctor?,dqgl69,"Hi all,

&nbsp;

I've spent over a year scribing in the emergency department and have absolutely fallen in love with it. I love the specialty itself as I love being a jack of all trades and love the massive amount of help we can offer patients in the ED. I love the practicalities of it: good pay, short residency, avoid ""living for the weekend/live to work"" lifestyle, etc. Some docs I work with make ~$350k working 11 10-hour shifts/month. Even if 3-4 of these are overnight, this just sounds amazing. So much time to spend at home with my family or doing whatever else I want. I know for sure emergency medicine is what I want to do, and as soon I can finish this freaking engineering degree I plan to go to medical school. 

&nbsp;

All that aside, out of all the 50+ docs I've worked with, only one of them speaks fluent Spanish. It is incredibly convienent to be able to speak easily with Hispanic patients, and I also believe it tremendously improves the quality of care they recieve. However, I speak no Spanish at all now, and feel that, to be the best ER doc I can be, I need to know Spanish - especially considering the ever increasing slice of the pie that Hispanics make up in America. The bedside translators do a decent job, but it is nothing like speaking the language yourself. 

&nbsp;

So, my question is, would it be worth spending a year or so abroad, delaying medical school matriculation by a year, to become fluent (or as close to fluent as possible) in Spanish? I don't neccessarily think it's worth ~$300k+ in lost income, but I also think part of me would severly regret not doing it every time I rolled the iPad translator cart into a Hispanic patient's room. Also, part of what I love about emergency medicine is the mobility, or the ability to pick up and be able to help people/maintain employment in just about any environment (e,g., military medicine, overseas field/mission work, locums living in the Caribbean, working in my small, rural hometown temporarily to care for a ill parent, being useful in the apocolpyse, etc.), and I feel that knowing Spanish could significantly increase my mobility. Whether or not I would ever actual take advantage of this mobility is questionable, but the psychological benefit of knowing it was there (and improved by my Spanish) makes me think learning Spanish might be worth it. 

&nbsp;

I'm sorry for the long rambling posts. I just need someone to tell me if this is worth doing or if I'm being silly. Thank you in advance!",2019-11-02 20:01:57

What is the rest of the medical community’s perception of EM docs?,dpp0m5,"I’m a med student considering EM as a specialty. I really like how fast paced it is and how we get the opportunity to see all different types of patients. I’ve talked to a few EM docs and they said they liked it because the residency wasn’t too long compared to other specialities and they have decently flexible hours. However, I’ve noticed that some docs look down on ER docs and say things like they don’t really know how to treat patients and they just pawn things off onto other specialties. What’s this all about? Is there any truth to this? Are there any other stereotypes of EM out there and is any of it true?",2019-11-01 04:50:10

New PA in the ER - All about the lower acuity,dpco6z,"First let me preface this with I realize between me and a doc, I'm expected to see the lower acuity stuff and I'm completely okay with that.

However what makes me uncomfortable is every time I interact with the director of the ER or assistant director, speed and the need to see lower acuity is always re-enforced. There is very little talk about managing or training during my orientation of managing sick patients.

Why this makes me uncomfortable is because ultimately I am still a provider in the ER and after my training there will be plenty of time its just me and the doc. I feel there will be plenty of times there is more than one sick patient in the department and while the doc is occupied with one I so far doubt my training will help me deal with the other. 

Any advice? 

Like I said I understand the role I have in the ER taking a lot of the lower acuity stuff but I feel like it's being pushed so much I wont be able to function like a provider can in a true emergency and I fear for my future patients. I'm trying to be as proactive as possible and some docs are helpful but the leaders dont seem to have anything organized for more acute stuff in orientation.",2019-10-31 10:22:55

Seeking wisdom from other ED nurses,dp64f1,"Hi all! I’m looking for advice when it comes to dealing with nurses who are receiving patients. I’m almost finished with my first year of nursing and I have about 6 months of ED experience. My hospital system requires us to call report for all patients being admitted. I wanted to briefly run by two different situations where I have had issues with the nurses on the receiving end (med/surg)

First patient presented for SOB initial BP 210s systolic. Admitted for CHF exacerbation and gave 80 mg Lasix IV. Last BP taken before transfer was 170s systolic. Received push back that BP too high/told that we aren’t taking care of patient even after explaining the change in blood pressure from arrival and how she receive Lasix. 

Second patient admitted for nausea and dehydration, was also hypoxic 85% room air on arrival. Patient was wearing nail polish on her fingernails so I had pulse ox on her 1st toe since her sats read higher there. She kept climbing out of bed (hx dementia) so ED doc ordered 0.5 mg Ativan IV which was given about 30 min before transfer.  I had to take her up to her room since we don’t have transportation in the middle of the night. Receiving nurse was pissed off at how the patient looked on arrival (lethargic from Ativan). Towards the end of my shift I went into the patient’s chart and saw that the nurse had written a note. In her note she put that the patient was only responsive to sternal rub and her sats were in the 80s.

My question is does anyone have any advice for me as far as how I should handle these situations? Any charting recommendations or anything else? Any feedback would be appreciated.",2019-10-31 02:05:43

Cross posted from nursing sub! I would love ANY professional insight you have on this!!!,do0b0d,"So I’m less than a year out from becoming a critical care nurse! We were just assigned our Patient Case Project which is 15% of our clinical grade. I don’t know if every program does this but basically we were given a general patient profile at our clinical site and our job is to interview other nurses, doctors, etc at the hospital about their personal experiences with that kind of patient and any important things to remember, expected outcomes, clinical presentation and progression, tips and tricks to give them quality care, etc. The idea is to present the topic and open a discussion on it at the end of the semester with the other students and the CI. Everyone else got typical profiles we see all the time but I got “Propranolol Overdose.” My site is a smaller hospital and I’ve already interviewed all the nurses but most of them haven’t had a patient with a beta blocker overdose, and the one who did said it was a patient who overdosed on a different type of beta blocker. I had one patient who overdosed on propranolol (which is why I was given this topic) but that’s the extent of my data. My supervisor told me I can use a Reddit forum for experiences as long as I can back up the reasoning behind what I present! My data from the one patient I had like this is as follows:

My patient was a mid-20’s female who came to the ER about 30 minutes after confusing her Xanax pills with her propranolol when she reached for them in the dark. The patient said that she had been having a severe panic attack and typically takes about 3.5 mg of Xanax to curb her symptoms and help her fall asleep. Her estimated dose of propranolol was about 1.2 g and she was about 110 lbs. She was initially lethargic and complained of drowsiness but nothing else although her mother stated she has had a seizure on the way to the hospital. Her bp was 92/71, rr was 16, Sp02 95% and heart rate was 58bpm. About 30 minutes post arrival her bp dropped to 70/50, PR 48, sp02 93% and rr 13. She began going in and out of consciousness and her GCS was 8. Her treatment from there was standard. She was intubated in the ER and given high dose insulin + lipid emulsion in the ICU. External pacing was considered and she continued to exhibit bradycardia and hypotension but her vitals ultimately stabilized and she was extubated 2 days post arrival and moved to another floor.

That’s all I have. My hospital’s protocol may be different than yours so if you have any comments/different ideas on the protocol we used for my patient please feel free to express them! I personally remember thinking that they intubated her prematurely and they used ketamine which I thought was weird (we use propofol normally). Any insight would be a great bullet point for my presentation. And if you have your own experience with a patient who overdosed on propranolol or even just beta blocker overdose can you share your experiences like how they presented and progressed and how they were treated, tips you may have for their care, and their outcome?

Sorry this is so long but I have permission to include forum citations for this project so I would be so grateful for anything and everything you’ve got!",2019-10-28 12:09:44

Things to look for in an EM residency program?,dg2i2h,"Hi all,

I'm an M4 applying to EM this year and starting to think about how to ""evaluate"" programs I'm interviewing with to determine which ones might be the best fit. Are there any objective criteria that indicate important things about a program? 

For example, does a larger class size mean better hours and more flexibility, or is that not at all correlated? Any major negatives of newer programs?

Question about away rotations in EM for medical student,df6779,"Hey guys! This sub has been useful in more ways than I can imagine. I had a query regarding my away rotations. So far, I have been able to secure a visiting rotation in EM and MICU at two separate university programs so far. I am still looking for other places, but slots seem to be mostly full. 

1.) How do PDs look at SLOEs from non university programs? I am looking at some spots that are available in programs that have opened in the past year, and was thinking of applying there. Do these yield any benefit?

2.)  Do Pediatric EM rotations issue SLOEs to the students? Do these count in the end while applying for residency?

New PA in the ER - Dealing with chronic pain patients,ddw19c,"This is less about the obvious drug seekers and those with chronic pain due to a known and preexisting injury. I'm trying not to be too slow but find that these patients really suck up a lot of my time. Someone who comes in with say severe abdominal pain I feel better with because I'm more likely to treat them with more potent opioid pain medication and have a workup started to find the source and hopefully offer them a solution. 

The people with the radiculopathies I'm finding to be a major time suck. Obviously my main concern is there is no underlying acute processes like new trauma or a septic process that can cause cauda equina, however I find that I am in with the patient longer during the interview and physical. I am more worried and feel helpless so maybe I'm just making sure I'm not missing anything. I also usually take my time discussing physical therapy and the need to see a PCP regularly, etc. I feel like the only thing I can do after ruling out the bad stuff is a strong anti inflammatory and maybe muscle relaxers and then D/C them with follow up.

Is it just something you get used to dealing with? Is it unusual for these patients to be more time intensive? Any advice?",2019-10-06 14:03:56

At what point would you contact a program,ddqtd1,"Hey everyone,
Here's another anxiety induced post brought to you by interview season. 
My question is at what point would you email a program to let them know you're very interested in them. One of the places that I rotated through that supposedly gave me good feedback and good evaluations according to my midpoint meeting, has given interviews to all of my classmates that rotated through there and some that haven't. This hospital isn't super selective.  Average step scores are relatively low but I felt like I really clicked with the faculty and the residents and I thought it was a great environment for me. It would be somewhere that I would rank. I know it's early but would it be reasonable to contact the program director.

What brought you to the ER today?,ddntov,"I ask this question of every patient I interact with. As a charge nurse during the busiest shift in my ER, I’m beginning to wonder if I should be asking this question of the staff I work with each day. 

Today my “normal” 9 hour shift stretched into 13 hours. No matter how hard I tried to stretch too few nursing and tech hours across too many patients, I couldn’t get the department cleaned up enough to ensure night shift could handle it alone. So I stayed. I was able to convince three others to do the same. 

All of us worked to exhaustion. The combined fortitude and willpowers of us holdouts and night shift made a dent, I think. None of the patients left before their evaluations. The people brought to us by medics that somehow didn’t get the message we were on divert got prompt care. All of the psych patients that were out of control got immediate stabilizing treatment. We dutifully checked in the three or four frequent flyers for their third or fourth visit in 12 hours, and treated them accordingly. 

Yet one event has me questioning my purpose. 2 very strong nurses informed me they had a strong suspicion of STEMI in a patient that had been brought in by his wife. This was happening at a time when I had many fires going, so I didn’t question it. I immediately began mobilizing support, including the doctor. I shunted resources in an already resource poor environment, because that’s what we do when the world goes sideways. The doctor went to the room and did his assessment. I had everything ready if the cath alert trigger was to be pulled. 

When I went back to the room and asked “would you like me to activate”, he tersely replied “only I can diagnose a STEMI”. What happened next can only be described as a complete destruction of moral. Everyone there no longer knew what they should be doing, including the wife and the patient. The universe seemed to stop for a brief, but earth shattering moment. The person with the most power and influence in the room seemed unaffected by it all. 

Later I was told that the response of staff and the level of intervention caused undue stress and anxiety to the patient and his wife...the same patient that was admitted to cardiology services as an inpatient (not as observation). This same patient had a rhythm that looked like v-tach and was symptomatic (diaphoretic, pale, nauseous, and weak). When he was transferred, his wife hugged the primary nurse and thanked them for their care and compassion. 

I know that all good people have bad days. Hell, I’ve had my fair share. Yet somehow I can’t help but notice that the frequency of bad days in those we ask the most of seems to be increasing. Sure, it can be frustrating, but I pride myself in asking “what do they need to succeed” instead of allowing bad behavior to drive my decisions or actions. My goals as a charge nurse (as I see it) are to keep the department flowing, insure the safety of staff and patients, and to help the providers achieve their goals of patient care. 

Recently, when I expressed frustration about the increased chaos and disorganization of a system that made sense 4 or 5 months ago, I was told that this may no longer be my passion. At first, this seemed to make sense to me. Maybe I was in the wrong field somehow, after over 7 years in the emergency department. Even though I felt a strong connection to this work out of the 13  previous years I have spent in hospital medicine in general, I must have gotten this wrong. Yet here I sit, wondering what changes need to happen to keep up with this recent shift and protect the most vulnerable of us and help them be safe and whole. 

What brought you to the ER today doctor? What brought me to the ER today? What will bring me to the ER in 7 hours from now?

What do I, or any of us, do when the last safety net is frayed and full of people-sized holes?",2019-10-06 03:50:21

Are there any contraindication for cooling measure after code with rosc?,dd268j,"Just found out my cousin had a couple cardiac codes (3) today.  He’s 40 years old.  Got admitted to tele for pneumonia. Was walking /talking / alert. But coded last night and this morning 
I am a fairly new ER nurse so sorry if I sound noobish
When I came to visit him he was already intubated with pressors. 
I asked the nurse what happened and she said he coded because he was septic. 
He initially got admitting for fluid build up in the lungs and pneumonia . 
From what I know he has DM, CHF, and on dialysis. 
When I went in to visit, he had 3 ice packs to his neck and around his head .  But this was for the “fever” per his nurse 
When everytime I worked and a pt coded with rosc, he would do hypothermic protocol/arctic sun
When I asked the attending how come cooling measures wasn’t done and she said because of his co morbidies. Cooling him off would do more harm than good because his “vessels would vasoconstrict” and the chance of him being awake and having brain function would be really low. 
I never knew that they were contraindications for not using any cooling measure after a cardiac arrest. 
his eyes are also involuntarily twitching 
Just wanted to know if I should speak up more or if she is right .  Thanks for any input .",2019-10-04 17:30:17

treatment of cardiac arrest caused by hyperkalemia,dcsuy3,"Hey there,

I'm a paramedic student looking for some clarification on how to manage a patient suffering from hyperkalemia induced cardiac arrest. My instructor, a paramedic of 10+ years, is stating to run the code like any other code- using ACLS algorithms and all. However, she is also stating that you should administer drugs for hyperkalemia as well; albuterol if able, calcium, and sodium bicarb. 

Obviously hyperkalemia is one of your H's and T's, and when identified should be treated- but is it worth taking the time mid-code to treat simultaneously? are there any benefits? any possible deficits?

I am an EMT student currently. We made it through the medical half of the class and I really excelled at handling medical situations. I am a great student and am typically at the top of my class. We just switched to trauma yesterday. Our instructor showed us a video of a horrible trauma incident, and I passed out just by seeing the blood, not even the injuries. Since then, I have been incredibly nervous that I won't be able to handle the rest of the class, and that if I were to work as an EMT, I would pass out and cause the patient harm by not being capable of tending to their wounds. I have been fine watching other videos, like removing a pulmonary embolus and cauterizing a brain bleed, but something about this trauma section seems different and more difficult to handle.

Is there any advice on becoming better at handling trauma cases? Is there a place in EMS for someone that is skilled in handling medical cases, but can't handle trauma?

~22,000 visits/year, single coverage nights, 2 hour drive each way, days with EM and FM doc

~50,000 visits/year, 3 hour drive each way, always with another EM doc except a few hours at night

Really don’t want to have to drive 6 hours a day if I don’t have to, but I also want to grow in my first years out and see enough sick patients.

Conflicted feelings about attending a trauma seminar,d2tohp,"Good morning fellow people of Reddit. So, I’m having conflicting feelings about attending a seminar/ conference with topics of pre/ in hospital trauma care and the like. It is in my hometown, and is being sponsored by a local medical flight agency, and one of the local trauma centers close to me. I would absolutely love to sign up and attend, but I feel like I would be an odd person out, as the seminar is meant for nurses, paramedics, and doctors, while I’m only an EMT still. A little background about me, I worked as an EMT in the East Bay Area in a fairly busy 911/ ALS system for about 3 years. I currently work as an Emergency Room Technician for an inner city STEMI/ stroke center, that has a fair amount of walk- in traumas (stabbings, GSW’s, assaults, etc.) My career goal is to obtain my BSN, and eventually get into CCT/ flight nursing. I have a passion for emergency medicine, and even though my “scope of practice” limits me to BLS skills and assisting with ALS interventions, I’m always looking to learn something new, as I believe that it will be somehow be useful/beneficial for me, my coworkers, and the patients we all get to see. So, I’d really love to go to this seminar, but I don’t want to be that weird guy that “technically doesn’t belong there”. Thoughts? Would I be considered a clown if I show up with the tittle of an “ambulance driver”? Any advice would be appreciated :) Thank you!",2019-09-12 06:54:23

Has anyone ever had a consultant admit a patient only to retract that admission shortly thereafter?,d110sf,"On mobile, sorry if formatting is poor. 

This happened yesterday. I had an otherwise healthy male with an atraumatic, rather large, diaphragmatic defect with herniation of the stomach, pancreas, hepatic flexure and some mesentery vessels into the thoracic cavity. No clear obstruction, but large gas burden. He had a leukocytosis, normal lactate, and pain control was a challenge. Ultimately admission for pain control, VS and lab trending was indicated, even though emergent surgery was not. 

Patient belonged to another local hospital system, who when given first rights of refusal, said they did not have the capabilities to deal with such a large defect, and thus deferred management to our system. 

Our general surgery team requested I speak with thoracic surgery, who unsurprisingly did not take this patient on. I was then asked to discuss with a local major university system, who also refused. 

So now after speaking with 3 other teams, general surgery at our facility accepts for pain control, trending, and coordination of surgical care. 

I went and updated my patient with our new plan, but as I was walking back to my desk, one of the gen surg APPs informs me that I now need to call 2 additional hospital systems for transfer before they will accept the patient. At this point I regrettably raised my voice in exasperation, and ultimately I did not have to make these calls and our gen surg team took the patient.

Has anyone ever had an admitting team accept and then backtrack on that admission?",2019-09-08 09:45:08

One honest thought is that I've had a fair number of patients who are hypersensitive so to speak (who complain of whole arm numbness after having a 2cm laceration on the hand for example) and I feel like stating that nerve damage is a risk of the repair is their open ticket to blame you for nebulous neuro complaints in the future.",2019-09-08 07:56:05

Ultrasound-related research ideas for a med student?,d0kjrb,"I'm a second-year medical student interested in pursuing EM and looking to get a little bit more research experience under my belt.

Given my lack of experience, I'm not really sure which chief complaint would be best to look at; I suppose one where some providers do use US, but others don't.

I’m a 4th year student and I have two more away rotations coming up. In the meantime I’m on an elective that has a significant amount of downtime. I was hoping to improve my EM knowledge base since that was the only complaint I had on my last rotation.

Is there another smaller book <400ish pages or other resources that are highly recommended?

"SLOE/LOR utilization advice, PLEASE!",czi50b,"I currently have 3 letters: 2 SLOES, (one from home, one from my first of 3 aways) and 1 non-EM letter. I'll be getting a 3rd SLOE from my current away rotation (early october more than likely), but I have one more away rotation after this (Late Sep-Late October). I'll admit I didn't quite understand the away rotation timing, and now I realize the last SLOE will be coming in basically early November.

My options, since ERAS has a cap of 4 LOR for each school, are the following:

1. Submit 9/15 with my current 3 letters & add on the current away SLOE when it comes in (hitting my 4 letter cap and making my last rotation obsolete)
2. Submit Sep 15: with the 2 SLOEs I currently have (technically, an incomplete application), add the 3rd SLOE from the current rotation in early October when I get it, then save the 4th letter spot for November.

If I go with option 1 schools will be wonder why I didn't upload my last SLOE. However, I'm also afraid I'd be sacrificing interviews by submitting an incomplete application with option 2 (say, if that 3rd SLOE was delayed).

I'd appreciate any advice, as I really don't know what to do from here! I know I necessarily do not need a 4th SLOE, but my rotation is in 3 1/2 weeks, and I would feel horrible canceling this late in the game- especially to a program I am very interested in.

I want to stop jabbing her with needles or inserting catheters into her bladder, I want to let her leave this world surrounded by her family and not in the middle of the night on a ward.

"When to get ""baseline"" labs?",cz9tpv,"Hello everyone. I wanted a brief discussion on the idea of getting ""baseline"" labs on most patients in the ED. My attendings seem to have vastly different opinions on this. Some of my attendings are purists who expect me to have a specific reason for getting any lab, which makes sense to me. Others get CBC, BMP on most patients regardless of clinical symptoms, especially if they are old or on meds. I didn't agree with them necessarily, but adjusted my presentations accordingly.

That is, until last night. We had a \~55 y/o F with a history of hypertension on lisinopril/HCTZ come in with complaints of episodic sharp 10/10 chest pain lasting \~1 minute and occurring 1x/wk for 1 month. The episodes became more frequent occurring 5x yesterday which is why she presented to the ED. She also complained of unrelated episodic palpitations occurring 1/week for 1 month. She says she took her own pulse during these episodes and it was normal. She had a family history of cardiac disease so she was worried and came in, but by the patient's own admission the symptoms are most-likely due to anxiety since she lost her daughter recently. She was asymptomatic in the room and her exam was 100% normal. She sees her PCP regularly and had mentioned to her about her palpitations but she was reassured that there was nothing to worry about. Her last set of labs were 2 months ago and were normal.

I presented this patient to my attending and my plan included an EKG, troponins, and CXR to rule out ACS, pneumonia, pneumothorax, rib fracture. All of these were very unlikely in my mind, but I figured even if it is anxiety, knowing her heart and lungs are functioning well would reassure her. My attending added CBC, BMP to the work-up because he likes to get baseline labs on elderly patients.

anyway, her sodium came back 120. Turns out she had been started on the lisinopril/HCTZ combo \~4 months ago. My understanding was that sodium imbalances occur withing the first week or two of starting the medications. but her labs were normal 2 months ago and she had no other obvious reason for being hyponatremic. We decided to admit her and while we were waiting for admission she had an episode of palpitations that were caught on the monitor. She was throwing PVCs and her rate was irregular for \~1-2 mins before converting spontaneously. She got NS 150ml/min and got admitted. The rest of her labs came back showing low serum osmolarity, elevated urine osmolarity, and elevated urine sodium, which is consistent with diuretic use (could also be adrenal insufficiency).

So I guess I'm wondering what you would do in this situation, and what the recommendation is for me to incorporate into my own practice. I would have sent this patient home, and she might have seized in the car and hurt herself. But at the same time, I don't like the idea of ordering labs without any clinical suspicion just in case there is something wrong.

&#x200B;

edit: The reason I didn't want CBC/BMP was because I did not suspect anemia as she did not have weakness/fatigue, or pallor/decreased cap refill on exam. I didn't suspect elyte imbalances as she had no nausea/vomiting, she wasn't out in the heat for a long time, she had no weakness, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, or vomiting. She had started HCTZ, but that was 4 months ago and she had normal labs 2 months ago so I didn't suspect that to be the cause. She did later admit to muscle cramps, but I never even thought to ask that on my ROS.",2019-09-04 09:18:07

"Cardiogenic shock in the setting of MI, which do you choose: dobutamine, levophed, dopamine or a combo?",cy4kzq,"It seems there is significant practice variability and opinion in this area. I've been using norepinephrine first (sometimes I titrate on dobutamine if they remain in a low flow state)-- the cardiologist told me when norepinephrine is given alone it prioritizes pressure over flow, which usually improves the blood pressure initially, but potentially causes deterioration thereafter... thoughts?

EDIT: changed levo/levophed to norepinephrine wherever I used it... can’t change the title 🤷🏼‍♀️

UPDATE: thanks for all of the info! I read through all of the comments and the trials mentioned. I still can’t find anything other than theoretical literature stating that using norepinephrine alone could cause harm. I am still going to use it in cardiogenic shock secondary to MI.

The reading was enlightening. Slightly off topic, but I’m motivated to look harder for valvular sources of cardiogenic shock on my initial bedside echo (god forbid they stay in the ED long enough for a formal echo + formal read). Then I’ll consider changing the meds to match the valvular pathology. Otherwise, I’m probably going to stick with norepinephrine +/- dobutamine during their initial resuscitation in the ED...",2019-09-01 16:04:51
ED Physicians and Staff - how do you manage an inappropriate patient?,cy05xl,"I've seen this handled in several different ways during my several audition rotations, and I just want some consensus on how your ED manages these patients.

I'm just a student, but from what I've seen it seems like most healthcare staff stratify inappropriate patients (sexual or racial comments/jokes) into a few categories that sort of guide their responses:

1. Old patient (male or female). 
2. Disoriented psychiatric patients.
3. Intoxicated (drug or alcohol).
4. Belligerent / Violent / Handsy.
5. No other excuse, just straight sexist or racist.

Categories 1-3 I have seen handled with chastisement (""That language / statements are not allowed and are innapropriate, please stop saying that"") all the way to security involvement (1 to 1, or security-supervised patient care).

Category 4 I have seen mostly discharged as soon as life threats are ruled out due to continued or persistent inappropriate behavior.

It's the category 5's I really have questions about - it seems some providers either straight up ignore them, laugh it off, or will acquiesce to their demands (example: ""I don't want to see a X-race doctor, get me a Y-race doctor."" so they switch docs as to ""not deal with the headache of it"").

How do you personally, or does your ED overall, handle these patients? Are there any legal barriers - for example, I know office-based practices can ""fire"" patients after some time, but that's not a luxury we have in the ED for a new patient or repeat offenders?",2019-09-01 09:37:11

I find myself getting overwhelmed, and then I shut down and fall into a vicious cycle of increased workload worsened by lack of action. Last night for example I had to coordinate care of a patient with psych and the patient's PCP. This was so tedious and time consuming that my productivity tanked. I'm sure there was a way to be more productive during this time, but I had a hard time doing anything else because I was so focused on this one task. This is just one example of several. I also have a hard time pulling the trigger on more consequential care decisions, like whether or not to get a CT or whether or not to discharge.

I feel like most of the seniors and faculty know I'm the slow intern by now, and I'm worried I'll never get their respect. I'm extra anxious because some of my co-interns have their shit together so we'll already, and do way better on sims than I do. Over all, I'm worried I'll never get good at this job. Any input would be appreciated.",2019-08-29 10:52:39

Prevalence of consults in the ER,cvgyc3,"Hello, all. I am a pre-med student interested in possibly pursuing emergency medicine.

Seeing patients in the community,cvgxun,"Hey my crew, I have recently had a few really welcome experiences where I'm out in the community, one time shopping and another time at a town sponsered event with my kids, and was approached by appreciative former patients. 

It was so nice in a purely medical way to see how well their injuries had healed - one orthopedic and demonstrating unconscious beautiful ROM, and the other a complex laceration that looked pretty good (better than expected).  They were both really sweetly thankful (and one had sought me out in a crowd to do so). 

However, I was surprised at my initial sense of being flustured because I'm wearing my ""mom hat"" not my ""doctor hat"" and I don't code switch easily.  I'm tongue tied, not knowing what the right response is.  If they're volunteering things, that means I'm not violating their confidence if I confirm?   How much of the violence in their presentation do I confirm in front of my children?   When I next have very very specific medical curiosity about full return to function and stifle myself, would there have been any correct way to ask those questions?  

I guess I am looking for other people's similar stories and opinions.",2019-08-26 14:21:28

Where is the flexibility in EM?,cr9egv,"I've decided to pursue EM over some other specialties that are considered more 'lifestyle friendly' because it's what I've enjoyed the most so far. I still often see EM shift work lauded for it's flexibility, but from what I've read/heard I'm having trouble seeing where this is actually the case.

* Nights/weekends/holidays basically without exception - I've basically made peace with this fact (the nights was the biggest drawback for me)

* Not easy to go PT - Groups would rather have people work full time I would assume due to easier scheduling and paying less in benefits, which is understandable

* Demanding shifts which essentially necessitate days in between - I often see medical students raise the idea of frontloading shifts early in the month to have 2 weeks off at the end, but then are shot down by seasoned attendings stating that this isn't actually feasible long term, compared to say hospitalist work which is considered less demanding where people have no problem doing 7/7 or 14/14

So as far as I can see the only real flexibility is being able to get a *specific* time off if you need it (eg, your kid's field trip needs chaperones on a weekday morning, you can get that off no problem) but not much else.  Anyone with more experience care to shed some light on this?

Advice on what SLOEs or letters should be sent?,cpmtjb,"Fairly individually based question here, but I get great vibes from this sub/community so I figured it'd be okay to post. 

I'm a MS4 on my second EM rotation. I'm pretty confident that I've gotten a decent SLOE from the previous smaller community hospital, and pretty confident that I'll get another decent SLOE from this rotation at a more well known and respected program. 

Both will be done by the Sept 15th ERAS send date, but I know you can send up to 4 letters total. 

So I'm left to choose from:
1)  An individual letter written by an EM doc I did research with and know well that will be done by sept 15th. 
2) A SLOE from another smaller community hospital in a geographically favorable spot that will be done by early October
3) A SLOE from a more well known program at a larger center in a geographically favorable location that will be done in early November.

SLOEs and general advice on away rotations?,cnxuv4,"Hi everyone! 

I am a current MS4 and on my first away rotation/first EM rotation ever and not sure how to feel after my first few days. I am just getting back into the swing of simple things like interviewing patients after not doing so for a couple of months. So far, I am enjoying the rotation and am getting along well with everyone (this institution's people are all around amazing!), but feel somewhat conflicted about myself/my performance and how my attendings are perceiving me. I also am a little bit intimidated by the other MS4s (who are also great) but they have all had previous EM rotations under their belt. Comparison is the thief of joy and so I never really buy into that, but with the nature of SLOEs literally ranking you against your peers, I find it a little difficult not to be somewhat hesitant and nervous about where I stand among them. 

My priority, of course, lies in being able to learn as much as I can, but the SLOE is obviously a huge part of the rotation as well, and ultimately, my goal is to do well and match into EM. I definitely feel like I don't know much, and my plans often feel wrong or incomplete, which is how learning occurs, but I often feel that little pit feeling in my stomach whenever I get shot down haha. I just want to know how big of a role these knowledge gaps play into ones evaluations/SLOEs.

Emergency App idea,cnex1j,"Hi guys 

I'm in Oz and on the final stages of training before becoming a specialist. I'm at the stage where I'm beginning to develop my own special interests and I've found that portable medical technology and knowledge is one of my favourites.

I know there are apps like Medcalc out there that help remind clinicians of formulas and guidelines but I don't yet know of an app like what I am thinking.

My idea is a simple Emergency Calculator.

Instead of looking up the formula you want and then inputting the details I was hoping it work in the manner below.

Simply input all the details of the patient as you have them such as all blood results/initial obsrrvations/vbg/Any results in a proforma.

The calculator then runs all the formulas that are commonly used in ED such as anion gap, A-a gradient, winters formula etc etc and then just provides all the results on the next page.

It would be up to the clinician to check through the results and use the info they want.

I like this idea more than the Medcalc version as I have found that sometimes you may not even be thinking of using a certain method until you see s result and then it may  be extremely beneficial in your management choices.

Anyway I'm post nights so I may be babbling.i have no programming skills whatsoever but I am happy to learn. If anyone would know of a good starting point or even keen to help then join the discussion below.

Intern needing to get organized in the ED,cjmfs5,"I just had my 4th actual EM shift since last July's away rotation and honestly feel like I'm just barely treading water in the ED. Specifically, I feel like the senior (one intern and one senior on at a time most of the time) has 2/3 of the board and I have 1/3 at the most. Also feeling like I'm going into rooms half-cocked because I feel pressure to sign up for people before the senior does, and don't get to do a deep chart dive before I feel like I need to be getting in there. (It's been drilled into us not to sign up until pretty much ready to go into the room). Then I come out and present also half-cocked because I feel too much time crunch to look up some of the things I should have in my plan before the attending asks me ""so what's up with 36?"". What am I getting wrong here, and how do I balance quality with efficiency?

Secondary question being priority of tasks in the ED. Dispo is #1, then some order of calling consults, doing procedures, ordering things for existing patients, and I think seeing new patients is last priority unless critical? Correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks in advance!",2019-07-30 17:38:17

1. I have some doubts about the ability of recently overdosed patients to trust me.
2. I do a sufficient job about communicating the risks of drug misuse and the options for rehabilitation.
3. I believe the emergency department or urgent care is a good place to receive overdose education.
4. I believe the physician’s role is important in contributing to the resolution of the opioid crisis.

So in my workplace both patients needing immediate care like you know, gunshot wound and admissions by ambulance are received in red area.

I worked there from time to time and I say some ambulance deliveries are a delight. I don't want to get into specifics but sometimes it is really a waste of gas for the ambulances.

I talked with paramedics about it and they said that they don't want to get into legal troubles for denying the patient, when i talked with my friends who worked in HQs of emergency services, they agreed with it. They almost never refused to dispatch an ambulence for an emergency call no matter what the problem is.

Is it similar with you guys too? Do emergency service HQs dispatch ambulance to any call, i don't mean prank calls or smth, for example, did you get a patient with tooth pain admitted with ambulance? What is the legal basis of patient-acceptance through ambulances? Are they regulated?

Ultrasound Guided Peripheral IVs,ce9dgl,"I work as a physician in a busy, large trauma center in the USA. For the most part, ultrasound guided IVs are placed by physicians in our ER.

Get out of jail free phrases,cdxqu9,"I am looking for input on how to handle situations where the police bring in a patient that is under arrest and en route to jail states suicidal ideation.

I am a nurse in a rural hospital where this has happened on a few occasions. We do not have psych available for consult. Our closest mental health facility is two hours away and will not take patients who are under arrest.

Essentially we are handcuffed to these patients until we can make a case that they are not suicidal and can be cleared for jail which leaves a lot of gray area for interpretation.

I have performed a phq-9 and Columbia on these patients and it is obvious that they answer the questions with the intent of getting the highest score possible.

We use cerner and our CHIO is against building a new algorithm.

Manually checking is obviously not feasible and a waste of time. 
2) without some kind of best practice alert or reminder in the EMR we would be relying on employees to remember to do everything. That’s too much room for human error.

Role of Lidocaine in I&D,ca7bh5,"I’m a medical student just starting my work in the ED. Yesterday I had to perform an I&D on a labial abscess and my attending told me not to use lidocaine because it is ineffective in infected tissue. All I used was freeze spray prior to the initial incision. The rest of the procedure including breaking up the lobulations was done with no anesthetic and the patient did not tolerate it well. 

So I understand that local anesthetics become charged in an acidic environment and this decreases their efficacy, but is this reason enough to not use any local anesthetic? From my basic understanding of chemistry, at a low pH not 100% of the compound becomes charged, only a higher percentage of it. And it’s not like infected tissue has a pH of 1. Even if it is 50% effective, hell, even if you use it only for the placebo effect, I feel like it would be worth it given that lidocaine is cheap and safe. 

Do you guys/gals use lidocaine For I&Ds? Is there something I’m missing here?

Edit: thanks everyone for your responses. I didn’t mean to make my attending sound cruel. To be fair he did mention how there have been some studies that do a wash out of the abscess with lidocaine and how that helps. And after I broke up some loculations and the patient was not tolerating well, I suggested to the resident that maybe now that most of the puss had been drained the lidocaine would work well and they agreed so we did end up injecting lidocaine through the incision site and that helped the rest of the procedure go more smoothly. But it sounds like the consensus is that lidocaine should be used around the abscess prior to the initial incision even. 

Edit 2: thanks everyone for your answers. I have learned a lot. If any of you have other advice/practices I would love to hear about it.

Edit3: today I had another abscess, Lower back. Discussed what had been discussed in this thread with resident. Pushed for lidocaine, but resident disagreed because it is “ineffective in abscesses”. Said topical is reasonable but unnecessary in this case because the abscess had already come to a head. I made a small <1cm incision with maybe 0.5cm depth and was able to drain maybe ~10 cc of pus. No need to break loculations. Patient tolerated it great. Said it felt better immediately after I cut. So I think in the original case the abscess was too large and complex (I suspect that patient had HS given the history) and in a sensitive region. I also think I cut deeper and wider than I should have (~2-3cm cut, ~1cm deep). I am curious if you all would agree with the resident in this new situation.",2019-07-08 03:50:50
Ketofol (1:1 versus 30% Ket:70%Prop),ca2ypl,"I'm sorry for my lacking knowledge. I was thinking today about Ketofol proportional use for procedural sedation. Since Ketamine has more clinically relevant emergence reactions once hitting partially dissociative dose (0.4mg/kg or more). Do you still prefer Ketofol as 0.5mg/kg (partial diss dose) of Ketamine and 0.5mg/kg of propofol (1:1). I understand anxiolytics properties of porpofol may theoretically help negate or reduce emergence reactions from partial dissociation.

Does your hospital require RN’s to call report prior to sending Pt’s upstairs?,c9y3ub,"I am curious what others ED’s are doing. We got rid of it for a couple years but they brought it back. We are part of a multi hospital system and the only one that calls report. The other hospitals wait 20 mins and send Pt up, if receiving RN has questions after reviewing chart they are to call ED. 
This has caused a huge delay in getting Pt’s upstairs during high volume times. Our ED  sees about 220 and routinely holds 20-40 boarders for most of the year.


Edit:
I appreciate all the feed back from everyone, even a few floor nurses responded ( not sure why they are in an Emergency medicine group) and the insight is helpful. We can all admit we don’t understand fully what other’s are dealing with if we have not experienced it ourselves.

Now I’m newish to medicine, same ER, same patients. My new role, now I see seekers are different in perspective, as an np. “This time
Could be the time” is what goes through my head. I look at everyone differently and I’m afraid to label them as “seekers”. Curious how other previous nurses, now providers, handle this.  It seems that the “ah they’re seeking “ will be the negligent death of someone.

Edit: physicians I 100% want feedback, as you have had a different “upbringing” with ER patients.  Maybe not for some, but My experiences as an RN and the frequenters, adds an ethical dilemma.

-HD Monitor for viewing radiology studies
-Tonometer (world of difference from tonopen)
-Lucas CPR Device
-LARGE HDTV we keep in our resus room so everyone can see video laryngoscopies/ fiber optic bronchs 
-A (working) slit lamp

SL NTG vs Paste vs CPAP,c3oymj,"Looking for some thoughts on treating CHFers in an environment w/o access to IV NTG. 

As a medic my protocols allow for 0.4-0.8 mg NTG SL spray/tablets every 5 minutes as long as SBP is above 120. It also allows 1” of topical NTG paste and CPAP up to a PEEP of 10. 

I believe most of my coworkers start with a dose of the SL spray then secure the CPAP mask. They then apply the paste and avoid breaking the seal on the CPAP for the duration of the call. 

However after looking at the pharmacokinetics of the paste and seeing articles like this one (http://ems12lead.com/2015/07/22/nitro-paste-is-not-an-emergency-medicine-drug-the-evidence/), I’m leaning towards briefly breaking the seal to continue delivering double-taps of the spray.

How to manage work induced anxiety?,c34em9,"Hi, I've been an RN for 4 years now and find it thoroughly fulfilling. Despite being an exceptional nurse by all measures, pt satisfaction scores, clinical skills and positive work attitude, I find myself struggling with severe anxiety and paranoia on my days off.

Got airway on my mind,c0owkz,"had recent case that I’ve been thinking a lot about recently. I am fresh out of residency, less than a year as an attending.



I work in the community in three different sites, and the other day I was working single coverage at one of those less resourced sites. Had a two-year-old come in in status




No previous history of seizure just new onset absence seizures back to back with no return to baseline. Got benzo’s, phenytoin, Keppra, no change in mental status, arranged for transfer to tertiary care center by helicopter, which was when we decided it would be best to take this kids airway before she gets loaded up in the helicopter.




Around the time this patient first came in, I had asked the respiratory therapist to prepare for an airway, and we had RSI drugs pulled up from the beginning, everything seemed ready to go until we were actually about to do it. Had a Mac 2 and 4.0 cuffed tube ready. I asked for back up devices to find that there were no peds bougies, no peds LMA, no supraglottic devices available at this facility at all. Later on, it was discovered that we did have it tucked away in some secret compartment somewhere, but at the time nobody knew where they were. 




We went with propofol and succinylcholine, Per the request of the tertiary care center. I was somewhat surprised by the incomplete relaxation I got with the succinylcholine, as there was still some muscle tone when I went in, plus the mouth was pretty small. Found epiglottis easy, seated in valecula easy, but when trying to fold it up, could see bottom of arytenoids only. Some gentle laryngeal pressure and easy grade 1 view. Tube went in easy despite small mouth opening. 




All in all, from blade entering mouth till balloon up was probably under 30 seconds, however during this time the kid had already desatted into the 60s which came up immediately with bag valve ventilations, but I’m still pretty surprised that the kid had such low reserves and dropped his sats so quickly. Makes me even more scared in retrospect realizing that I had only an OP airway and time as my only back ups. 



This is so different than residency, and which we probably would’ve had anesthesia residents in attending‘s, multiple forms of video laryngoscopy present, ED attendings present.




Not really sure where I am going with this, just wanted to tell it to someone I suppose. Also want to hear your airway stories, doesnt have to be the crazy surgical or fiberoptic airway, just whatever youve had recently or made you think or sweat a little. 



Also, I have bounced around the idea of making an airway specific sub? So anesthesia and others could chime in. Could be a place for war stories and learning from each other. Any interest in that?",2019-06-15 10:00:25

I know there's a ton of variation within countries so I'd like to know more about urban, tertiary care centres.

How safe do you feel...Epinephrine versus isoproterenol,bva9n8,"Sorry if it's a silly question. The health authorities/regions I have worked with have policies to guide ER/Critical Care practice, and at times, have strongly recommended not to administer epinephrine concurrently with isoproterenol AND **wait for a certain period of time (at least an hour) after epinephrine before starting isoproterenol**. Rationale being that both may have aggressive additive cardiac effect leading to worsening arrhythmias.  

However, with bradycardia algorithms, most ER articles suggest starting with Epinephrine + Dopa for symptomatic bradycardia *if other interventions have failed*, and if Epi + Dopa fails as well, to begin with isoproterenol administration (+/- bolus with infusion). I know it will depend on severity of hemodynamic instability in patient, but **how safe do you feel starting isoproterenol right after Epinephrine (without that waiting period in between)**.

*Would you abruptly stop Epi infusion (When Dopa + Epi fails) so you can begin to administer isoproterenol (so to avoid concurrent use of Epinephrine and Iso); or would you titrate Epi down while starting with isoproterenol (it is ""kind of"" concurrently administering Epi + Iso)?*

Feeling conflicted on what steps I should take next in my career,buwg4a,"Hello all! I’ve had some internal conflict over the past few months over where I should take my career in emergency medicine/ healthcare next. I am 22 years old and work in the greater Bay Area in California. I’ve been an EMT for AMR in a busy 911 system for about 3 years, and have recently been working part time at a hospital as an ER Tech since February of this year. I have a passion for emergency medicine, truly care for my patients, and would like to continue working in healthcare as a lifelong career. 

My initial goal since I was 15 was to go to paramedic school. For some reason, that dream still hasn’t left my mind. Most of everyone I talked to before I went to EMT school, and most medics I talk to now, all tell me the same thing- “I would only go to medic school if I were trying to get a fire job”, and I honestly don’t think the fire service is a good fit for me. I tried volunteering with two different departments in the past 3 years and both times left a bitter taste in my mouth, and made me believe that much more that I wasn’t meant to be a firefighter. Working as a paramedic in my area, you make decent money if you’re only providing for yourself and maybe one other person. It’s not necessarily a career that has promise of longevity, and private EMS companies are filled with greed. Most older paramedics I know aren’t too happy with their jobs, and constantly say that they wish they would’ve found a way out a long time ago. They have back issues, general health issues, most only work nights because there’s a night pay differential of almost 10 bucks more an hour, and their home lives suffer because they are always at work, or always sleeping. I love my job in EMS; I love the autonomy with treatment and patient care, I love the relationships you build with your partners and coworkers, and I love those calls where you ACTUALLY make a difference, or genuinely save someone’s life... but it’s just not a job that’s meant to last, and I have no desire to go into the fire service. All of this pushed me towards the hospital route, and I got my first hospital job this year after a couple months and 90 applications later 

Working in the ER has it’s ups and downs, but it’s enjoyable for the most part. I have an extended scope of practice in some aspects- I can do blood draws, do casts/ splints, and a couple other oddball things. I do a lot more wind care and assist in medical procedures like conscious sedations, sutures/ stitches, we are a stroke center so I partake in assisting with stroke scales, prepping the patient to go to CT/ MRI, and a bunch of other really neat things. The culture inside the ER is so much different though. It’s very cliquey and I feel like I have to be careful about who I talk to about what, or how I perform in front of certain people ( who I’ve been told are notorious for trying to get people they don’t like fired). It seems like drama is constantly going around and despite working for a hospital corporation that treats their employees very well and pays handsomely compared to other hospitals in the area, people are still unhappy there. Most of the nurses are cool, but it seems like most of their job is giving medications and charting for hours on end, and that seems no fun to me at all. The patients behave as expected, and I have no problem with people that have bad attitudes, but there’s a multitude of family members that will come in trying to argue with doctors/ nurses/ techs/ management and always pull lines like “oh well I was a director at *insert hospital that no longer exists* back in * insert irrelevant year* and this is how WE did it” or “why do you have to *insert procedure name*? They’ve already done that the last time we were here!” and despite being calm and trying to educate patients and their families, they just seem to get angrier. I understand that it’s just human nature, and people will always be people no matter where you go, but at least in the field we had the ability to ask families to leave the room if they weren’t needed for patient history or the like, and if they started acting belligerent we were able to stand our ground to a degree, and get PD involved if it escalated any further. So, that’s where I’m at with the hospital setting of healthcare. 

Anyways, I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m throwing a bitch fit, I’m truly trying not to. I’m just someone who naturally tries to keep the ball rolling with my progression in life, and I feel like the ball just stopped rolling. Is there anyone that’s been in my shoes that can help me find some perspective? Perhaps offer some advice? Thank you very much if you took the time to read this, and I would appreciate any response:)",2019-05-31 07:38:10

Pediatric ED vent,btxlhv,"Quick backstory before I unload: I'm a pharm tech in the ED at a peds hospital. My main job is to collect medication histories on patients that are admitted, high acuity, or have extensive medical histories. However, I work overnights and I'm the only tech here after 1 am. Pharmacy responds to all codes/traumas/alerts/etc, and I am often needed to assist the pharmacist drawing up meds and fluids and whatnot. Been here over 2 years now and I absolutely love it. 

That being said, I am writing this as a family passes by in the hallway behind me. They just watched their daughter/sister/aunt traumatically arrest and pass away. She had a congenital heart defect with some kind of repair a few years ago, I don't know what happened tonight that led to the arrest, but she didn't make it. 

As emergency medicine people, we know this kind of shit happens. All day, every day, people die. Children die. I have seen kids die from hot cars, pools, bathtubs, co-sleeping, MVCs, unrestrained ejections, ATVs, golf carts, GSWs. I have seen all kinds of traumas. I have watched a child seize for 30 minutes, all of our meds having no effect. I see teenagers EVERY DAY overdose on their antidepressants or Tylenol or benadryl and attempt suicide. Some days it's a nightmare mix of all of it. 

Today, I'm fucking tired of it. I'm tired of Death roaming these halls. I realize my role is minimal. I am not giving direct patient care, but I AM at the bedside. I can draw up intubation meds lightning fast. I can have your bolus ready and primed. I hear the same screaming and wailing of a mother who just lost her child, her baby. Summertime is always the worst, and it's ramping up. And after all of this, I have to put on a smile and walk into the next room and pretend to be normal for the next patient and their family, and listen to the mom bitch about how long they've been waiting for her kid's strep test or x-ray to come back, and silently restrain myself from reminding her to be grateful that her child is even alive, because nobody really understands until it happens to them or they see it for themselves. 

I work with the best nurses, paramedics, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, docs, child life specialists, radiology, the whole team. It is truly inspiring to watch everyone come together and prepare for a kiddo that's coming in. It's what keeps me coming back, even though tonight I'm having such a hard time. I feel very blessed to be even a small part of that team. 

Thank you, all of you. You inspire me and motivate me to do a better job. 

Thanks for reading and letting me vent, keep up the good work.",2019-05-28 22:13:47

Factors affecting Coronary Perfusion....,bt13aq,"I am sorry for my lacking knowledge and I was wondering if the following that I could gather is correct? I greatly appreciate your input.

For self-study, I was reading about coronary perfusion and what I could deduce from different sources is that the Coronary perfusion (Coronary O2 supply) is majorly dependent on CBF (coronary blood blow), where CBF is vastly reliant on CVR (coronary vascular resistance), where CVR is in turn significantly dependent on (coronary) Vascular Radii, and last but not least, Vascular Radii (coronary) is dependent on the following four factors: External Compression + Endothelia Factors + Local Metabolites + Neural Factors.

 

**I understand that Myocardial O2 demand factors would play role here too. And also, given that we are multi-vessel system, vascular radii cannot fully determine vascular resistance because parallel connections of arterioles decrease coronary vascular resistance to compensate for increased resistance generating from having small radii.** 



Here is how I could come up with the above mentioned conclusion:



Coronary O2 supply depends on:

	1) O2 carrying capacity (systemic O2 saturation + Hgb content)
		a. O2 carrying capacity depends on TWO things
			i. Hemoglobin []
			ii. And degree of systemic oxygenation AKA O2 saturation of blood
			iii. HENCE, in absence of anemia or lung disease where oxygenation is being affected, O2 carrying capacity remains fairly constant
				1) IT is the CBF which is DYNAMIC, and major determinant of Coronary o2 supply
		b. Myocardial O2 extraction capacity at rest is about 80% so there is NOT much room to expand the O2 extraction to 100% when exertion happens
	2) Coronary Blood Flow (CBF - determined by Coronary Perfusion Pressure + Coronary Vascular Resistance)
		a. CBF(Q) proportional to P/R (Pressure difference/Resistance)
			i. The FIRST branching off from aorta is the RCA and LCA (two MAJOR arteries of coronary)
				1) Thus whatever the difference better the pressures would be at end of diastole in LV and Aorta will be driving force of blood flow
			
		b. CPP is the pressure gradient = Aortic Diastolic Pressure (ADP) - LVEDP
			i. The reason diastolic pressures in both Aorta and LV matters is because subendocardial perfusion is LIMITED during systole because of external compression
				1) Subepi > Subendocardial perfusion during systole
			ii. ADP has to be > than LVEDP to have forward driving force
				1) HENCE, factors like aortic stenosis or decreased SVR will decreased ADP and hence CPP and hence coronary perfusion
		c. WHAT MAJORLY affect the CBF = ?Resistance or the Pressure difference (it's the resistance which is MAJORY dependent to Radii of vessels)
			i. Q (flow)=P (pressure gradient) / R (resistance)
			ii. R (resistance) = 8Ln/pi*r^4
				1) N = blood viscosity = FAIRLY CONSTANT
				2) L - length of vessels = FAIRLY CONSTANT
				3) Pi =  Constant itself
				4) r^4 = radii of vessels = MAJOR DYNAMIC OF RESISTANCE
			iii. Joining i and ii
				1) Q = P*pi*r^4 / 8Ln
				2) Q  (flow) THUS depends MOST on radii of vessels 
		d. What is Coronary vascular resistance ( R ) is dependent on:
			i. R (resistance) = 8Ln/pi*r^4
				1) R is majorly dependent on radii of vessels
				2) SINCE arterioles have the smallest radii - resistance will be affected more in arterioles
					a) Since arterioles are more embedded in subendocardial space, subendocardial space is more prone to being affected, when radii changes
			ii. Radii is DEPENDENT on:
				1) Extrinsic compression
				2) Intrinsic vascular autoregulation, which is dependent on
					a) Local metabolites, such as adenosine
					b) Endothelial factors, for example, NO and endothelin-1
					c) Neural factors (such as sympathetic or para tone)
				3) INDIRECTLY THESE ARE the MOST IMPORANT FACTORS regulating CBF, because they affect radii = radii affect resistance mostly = resistance mostly affects CBF",2019-05-26 12:57:08

Expedition: what if someone suffers from an acidosis?,brm8ef,"New nick for my and colleagues' privacy.

Ok, this is a very odd one. Just arrived at the end of the world for a few weeks of fieldwork, and one of my esteemed colleagues casually mentioned he occasionally suffers from mild bouts of acidosis brought on by exercise or physical work (yeah, guess what we'll be doing). Said he generally feels ok, but very short of breath and can't stop peeing out fluids. Lasts a few days. Said if this happens he eats a shitload of sodium bicarbonate or calcium citrate and feels ok again after an hour or so, until this stops working and he takes another pile. Showed us a big container of calcium powder.

Is he pulling our legs? Of course we're worried now about going to our research location with him. And this is not really part of an expedition first aid course. We've done fieldwork together before without problems.

Rigors chills the works. No AMS. Completely coherent. He though himself it was just the flu/viral illness but wanted checked out. Very healthcare literate. Thought it was slam dunk meningitis (his concern too). Tap came by crystal clear (no RBCs and got my Champaign) workup unrevealing. No white count. Fever responded to tyl. Guy looked much better and he wanted to go home. Was a signed out pending another lab, forget which now. Was dc’d. 
Blood clx came back next day. GNR. Called back. Admitted. IV abx. Endorsed some tingling in his L arm. CT showed phlegmom. MRI showed large cervical epidural abscess compressing CSpine c3-7. Drained. Did well.  Turned out to be eikenella. Thought to be from a single tooth which had eroded past gumline. Guy had great dentition btw. 
Wth... kinda scared me a bit tbh. My gut told me something was wrong on initial glance. So much so I started ceftriaxone and got LP kit immediately but he was looking so much better within just a few hours with a single dose of tyl and the abx that with a negative workup it didn’t look like he needed admission. He was on board and even agreed with everything and was reassured with workup.

In the course of my time working in the field I’ve always tried to respect and follow my pt’s cultural customs & traditions.

I introduced myself, and informed them that the ER Doc had ordered an EKG and that I would need to go under her gown to place the leads. The father did not like this and asked for a female instead. I left the room and informed the RN that she would have to do the EKG as there weren’t any female ED Techs on shift that night. What should’ve been a 5 min. task turned in to a half hour fiasco because the RN could not capture the tracing due to not knowing how to use that particular EKG machine. My fellow male tech laughed at the whole situation, and made a comment that if they weren’t such assholes their daughters Tx would be much quicker. My response was, “well, at least if she codes we won’t be expected to go in and help.” Which brings me to my question; at what point do you ignore the pt’s families wishes and just do what you were trained to do?

-6 months in vascular medicine (""angiology"", i.e. ultrasound of vessels + interventions)  
  
I've got planned:   
-6 months in a smaller ER  
-6 months in orthopedics  
  
I'm considering/trying to get into:  
-Cardiology  (up to 1 year)  
-Ultrasound rotation  (3 months)  
-maybe 6 months of ENT, outpatient pediatrics or pediatric EM
  
And that's all BEFORE the 1.5 years of ER training necessary for said diploma.

&#x200B;

I'm about the graduate residency and it has been tough. Quite disillusioned about medicine in general. I'm hoping that some of what I'm feeling is temporary, related to training and my current work environment but in case it's not, what kind of non-clinical options are there? I have a job lined up and \~250k in debt (paying it off in 2-3yrs), plan on being BC. I'm definitely fortunate in that I have more options than someone who didn't finish residency and a very secure fallback but money isn't everything and I would gladly trade some of it.",2019-05-10 06:44:10
Treatment for oblique fractures of spinous processes of C4 and C5,bm7a2i,"On Friday evening I was struck by a car and as a result, I have oblique fractures of C4 and C5. This sounds pretty severe to me, however when I left the hospital, the nurse just said ""take it easy for a few weeks and don't workout."" I then asked if I should wear a brace, and she said it was optional. 

&#x200B;

I then followed up with the neurologist that was recommended by the ER doctor and he said, after reviewing my test results and scans, that I did not need to see him. 

&#x200B;

Is this normal for a fracture of C4 and C5? This seems like a pretty severe injury imo. I am able to walk and move around alright, however my back is extremely stiff and I have limited mobility in my neck.

Rough Week in EM,blyj3y,"15 year medic spending time in a suburban level II trauma center. Been here a good while, have a lot of responsibility, experienced a lot of badness. All enough to convince me to apply to medical school at the age of thirty-three. And can’t see myself doing another speciality. 

BUT . . .

Past few shifts have stretched me. Twin deaths w/ delivery at 23 weeks. Mom did well. Today though, we unfortunately had to perform the Holy Grail of EM: perimortem c-section. Nobody survived. 39 weeks. Non-traumatic. I can’t say I’ve even remotely seen something like this before. Horrifically incredible.

EM Research Year? 3rd year Med Student,blxa2k,"tl:dr  Should I consider EM research year between 3rd/4th year?

&#x200B;

New 3rd year med student. Perhaps alittle early to be thinking about especially given I just started clinicals but EM is towards the top of my interests. Previous experience as EMT and have a MPH.

I know for some specialities a research year is a must, but for EM I have not heard of anyone doing it. I want to end up at an academic institution and I enjoy research. Some of my interests include anything public health related, EMS, and medical education. Money, time, and graduating with my original class is a nonfactor. Waiting on Step score but otherwise I think I will be an average applicant from a mid tier MD school with no red flags. 

Any downsides to taking a research year (between 3rd and 4th year)? Will it make me more ""competitive""?

How do I start preparing for EM now?,bkct3r,"Hey all, 

&#x200B;

MSII--transitioning to MSIII at a mid tier school in the west (yay for STEP 1 prep). Taking a quick study break because I'm very seriously considering EM (all but decided on EM but will keep an open mind during MSIII and MSIV). 

&#x200B;

A little background--was an ICU nurse for 11 years prior to med school, but I worked all over including ED--to include serious trauma. This included 5 years as an army officer and 7 months in a combat trauma hospital in Helmand, Afghanistan. Because of this, I feel like I get all the--""burnout"", shift work, 100 things to do in a shift and not enough time to do them--concerns. I know I can handle shift work and I know I can work at my best, during emergency situations with little or no sleep--in short, there is no real deterrent for me regarding the ""classic"" gripes most people have about EM. Also, I think it fits my personality--I'm more a get shit done, drink beer and listen to heavy metal type. Plus, I really like the idea of being busy as hell all day (like a nurse who's 12 hour day turns into a 14 hour day without eating or peeing) and then going home and being completely done. I also like the idea of the balance between holy shit moments, caring for those in need regardless of status, and the more mundane. I could go on. 

&#x200B;

I'm really posting to see what you recent residents and current attendings would suggest I start doing now in order to find the best fit for residency etc. My only concern is really quality of training. I can live anywhere and I'm not pedigreed at all--I want to have my ass handed to me and feel confident when I walk out the door on the last day of residency. 

&#x200B;

I know away rotations in 4th year weigh heavily, I know STEP is important....what else should I focus on?

Fellow ED Docs - what would you have done?,biwx3l,"I'm always intrigued by other people's and especially other countries training and decision making when it comes to ED so I wanted to pose 3 short cases and ask - what would you have done?

(FYI I qualified 2010 from Imperial Med school and now I am an ED Advanced trainee in Sydney for the last 3 year's,prior to this I had completed core training in Emergency Critical care in the UK NHS gaining membership to The Royal College of Emergency Medicine) 



1. 45yr old male clinical pharmacist. Presenting with severe abdominal pain and nausea. Crying out in triage. 3rd presentation for the same in 1 month with none prior. Nil pmh of note. Obs  stable and afeb.previously admitted and had CT showing duodenitis and gastritis. ATSP as he is agitated and demanding IV meds. When confronted is argumentative and stating that as a pharmacist he is aware he needs to be NBM and morphine has worked previously. States Endone (oxycontin) or paracetamol will upset his stomach. Offered IV paracetamol - declined stating as a pharmacist he is aware it's not as strong as paracetamol. I countered with policy stating stepwise management in analgesic control and as a pharmacist he should be aware of this.
Ultimately pt refused to calm down, threatened contacting senior management etc etc and I had to have him removed from my department without treatment.



2. 14 month old male. Nil pmh, imms utd, obs stable and afeb. History of 5 days of fevers with profuse diarrhoea. No vomiting. No blood. Drinking well. Had returned from Bali with symptom onset on the flight home. No rashes. Interacts very well. No signs of dehydration or resp distress. Happy chappy with clear UA. Spent 5 hrs in ED with TOF and stool culture with obs. No deterioration and remained well with stool sample sent and no evidence of blood. Attempted to DC pt to GP for follow up and mother became upset. Stated she felt like we hadn't done enough treatment. Stated she was expecting blood tests and Abx. That if all we were going to do was offer fluids she could have done this at home. Attempted to calm patient explaining reasoning that no current indication. That yes fever is a sign of infection but in itself not too concerning in a well child. That no signs of dehydration or overt sepsis is present therefore blood tests would not change my management even if the WCC was raised. She asked about Abx and I explained that unless the stool culture showed a bacterial source then it can often make the symptoms worse therefore unless we really need to it's often safer to wait for the culture results. Mother was still upset and threatening to leave therefore I said if she would like I will get the paediatric on call to come and review her child and I will support their decision fully. She accepted this, however when the specialist did not arrive within 20mins she self discharged. 



3. 7am end of night shift with day team arriving 8am. 84yr old female with PMH of HTN. Presents with family via walk in with 24hr history of vomiting. I was busy so asked my senior reg to begin the review.
Called urgently to the bedside. PT BP is 45 systolic and she is pale and sweaty. Moved to resus and one repeated - tachycardia 185 in VT. Recheck of BP showed 135 systolic and pt supine is back to normal gcs 15 states feels nausea but otherwise ok. Check on history finds pt had been well apart from vomiting for 1 day. Had had some reflux 2 days before. VBG showed no electrolyte imbalances but lactate 6. ?intrabdo pathology as source??? PT remained in VT with BP 90 systolic but GCS 15 requiring fluid bonuses occasionally but says 100% and decision made to chemical cardiovert with amiodarone. Loading dose completed and HR down to 145 but remains VT. PT remains like this for 1 hr. Bloods return and trop I >10,000. Primary ACS as cause. Urgent cardio consult who attended in 15 mins (on nights coming onto morning). Quick ECHO shows billowing LV wall. Decision made to shock DCCV 150J x 1 and pt back into NSR. PT went for PCI to 100% LAD occlusion.

Anyway I know it's lengthy but as you know it's hard to not put in the salient points.

If your a med student and don't understand some of the abbreviations I am sorry but tried to limit word count.

It will be interesting to see the replies.

Away Trauma rotation as EM resident??,bgjgcd,"Hey everyone, EM resident here finishing up my 1st year of residency. Absolutely loving residency thus far and thinking about my elective time over the next 2 years. For the most part our program has great relationships with the other services in our hospital (large level 1 trauma with >100,000 ED visit a year) with the exception of our Trauma service for reasons I wont go in to. Unfortunately our Trauma rotation is a pretty big letdown for the majority of our residents. We do get some penetrating trauma in trauma bay, but the way our Trauma service runs really limits what our EM residents are able to do. Our Trauma rotation essentially consist of being a note jockey for the entire service, consulting on potential general surgical patient's presenting to our ED, and maybe getting a couple procedures throughout the course of the month. Needless to say a lot of our residents have expressed concern about their trauma experience upon graduation of our residency program which is a damn shame because otherwise I think our program is absolutely stellar.

On a related note, do you prefer using a Morgan’s lens or a improvised set up with a cannula and IV tubing?",2019-04-21 14:43:16
Suicide HELP NOW!!!!,bfjef7,"Ok here is my story someone please help me asap.

My name is jakob, I have a lot of shit going on in my life and so three days ago I went to this depression chat room I found a while ago to talk to some people, mainly just vent. While there I met a few really good people, one was this girl (we will call her M). M is like m, she is 17, life is crazy and we are both struggling, and a few other things.  We got to talking and I dont know how to explain it, something in my gut just knew I could trust her and that I needed to stay in touch with her. So after we talked for a short bit I gave her my email so we could stay in touch. We talked about why each of us were in a depression chat room in the first place, I talked about me for a sec, and she explained to me that one of her best friends had commited suicide a few days prior, and her other friend was coming close to doing the same. She explained a few other things, and she told me that she didn't want to live anymore, she didn't see worth in her life and didn't think it mattered. Other things were said that I wont waste time explaining but over these past 2 and a half days we have been talking non stop bassically (except for sleep). I wont say everything that got said but I was able to stop her from killing herself last night. I got her to see some worth and find some reason to live for at least a few months. She was really struggling but I helped her get to a slightly better place and not dieing.  This morning we talked some more, she was still having a hard time but was doing a bit better and was going to spend the day with animals (her real joy) and was looking forward to that a lot. We were laughing together and she was looking forward to her day.  But then a few hours later she sent me a message saying ""hey I really don't want to try anymore"". I don't have time to explain our past conversations to explain that message but I think the message should be clear, she doesn't really want to try to live and find reason. I have messaged her close to a dozen times (2 - 3 messages an hour) and I havent heard anything from her. I am really really worried that she tried to kill herself, or worse succeded. She was doing better this morning but I think something happened that pushed her over the edge.

&#x200B;

I need to know if any 17-18 year old female was found dead or attempted suicide in missouri today. (i dont know a specific area) I need to know if she is alive. I won't explain it all but she is exremely important to me and I need to know. I don't have the ability to call any police departments right now or I would ask them myself. Can someone please find out for me, ASAP. Please I am begging you more than anything in the world.

&#x200B;

EDIT: SHE IS ALIVE, she got really sick a little after we talked and passed out for most of the day. the message was part of an incomplete message she wasnt able to finish. Thank you to the one person who tried to help",2019-04-21 14:35:18

Sometimes you learn things you never wanted to -Tales of the ER/ED-,bdju0n,"Obligatory- I am not a HCP, but have worked in hospital/healthcare security for nearly 2 years.

\-TLDR at bottom-

So, one night EMS+Police bring a frequent flyer into the ED. EMS gives report to the nurses with the security team present (myself and 2 other guys) So the guy had apparently been stuck in razor wire after attempting to climb over a chain link fence on the side of an apartment building and consequently had quite a few lacerations. He was aggressive when police approached at the scene (obviously on drugs) and so was shot with a 40mm non lethal projectile, as well as controlled by a police K9 (bork bork nom nom'd his leg) Once removed from the fence in a collective effort by police, fire, and EMS, he was handcuffed and arrested under the Mental Health Act (in custody for your own/public safety) Now, on the way to the hospital, this guy had shit himself on purpose, and was know to do this according to both officers, and EMS, obviously making him much less pleasant to be stuck in an ambulance with.. Now due to his multiple lacerations, many of which on his arms, he had bled a decent amount, and the fact he had shit himself, all with being handcuffed hands behind his back.. todays lesson rolls around.. Once he was medicated and more settled, it was time to remove the handcuffs and get this guy cleaned up, well.. What do you get when you mix brown diarrhea, and semi coagulated blood? PURPLE, yeah you get the worst smelling Bob Ross Purple Splendor finger painting that you never wanted to experience.

Dilemma in critical situations: Delaying TBI transfer versus GCS mandating intubation,bc9d7r,"I have been coming across a lot of articles and podcasts lately, mentioning that sometimes we rely too much on GCS to shape the ""grey situation"" more like ""black and white"". I have personally faced certain situations as well.


I have sometimes come across situations where a TBI (especially intoxicated) person whose GCS has deteriorated from GCS15 to 8ish within an hour from the point they were triaged/first seen, however, spontaneously breathing with SpO2 of 98-100% and no signs of resp distress or closing airway (such as stridor, snore or fluctuating O2 saturation et cetera). Ambulance is readily available on site to transport a non-intubated person to  the nearest neuro centre (within 30 mins reach by ambulance) where a person will ultimately benefit from surgical intervention (such as decompression, drains or such); however, since now the GCS is 8ish - it is mandated to intubate prior to transfer (this will require trained staff to transfer the patient as well) - in short, delaying the transfer and the window for surgical interventions. Would you in that situation (where a severe TBI who is spontaneously breathing with no signs of closing airway yet) feel comfortable in delaying the transfer to intubate the person to transfer the patient to the nearest neuro centre (which is not too far in reach from the transferring facility)?


I know there are many other factors that can and will be considered from one TBI situation to another, I tried to make the situation as simple as I could. 

I also understand that rapid deterioration may mandate intubation, especially if the route is going to be long;or one would rather intubate in a resourceful environment (in Hospital versus in ambulance); and that there are variation in mortality among permutations of specific scores (MVE) of GCS, so situations may differ from situation to situation.",2019-04-12 17:42:42

Is there any real fear of EM being replaced by mid levels?,bc57jf,"Hello all, I'm currently applying to medical school, so I am a long way to go before I am faced with the decision to specialize. However, I've had an interest towards emergency medicine for quite some time now. Yes, I know that can easily change once I'm in school and begin rotating, but unless something else completely swipes me off my feet I see myself steering towards it. 

However, I do have a fear that the position as a whole could begin to be filled by mid level providers over the years, since emergency physicians earn a relatively high income (as they should) for their services, with some earn a killing working half a month if they desire. Pardon my ignorance, but for those of you that are in the field itself, do you believe that there is a risk to this at all? With the talks that family med being potentially taken over by the high amount of PA's in the future, this is something that's been in the back of my mind for quite some time.

I. Am. Tired.,baqm6y,"r/emergencymedicine, I need a good rant. 

I am tired.

I have had a lot of deaths these past few weeks. I’ve seen a lot of sick, hurt people, for whom the entirety of a medical system was unable to save. I wish I could say I’ve had a lot of wins, too. But honestly, I haven’t. I haven’t done anything remarkable, I haven’t had a great save, I haven’t made a critical difference. Helped, sure. Saved, no. My car has seen lots of early morning tears.

It’s exhausting. To watch all this sadness. To tell person after person after person that they have cancer, that their loved one was drinking and driving, that we would keep going, but we would need to stop, eventually. Just say the word, and we’ll stop. Say goodbye. My 2am exhausted self has mastered the art of a gentle death exam. 

I have seen an incredible display of humanity. Burn out manifesting in a sharp word towards our repeated imbibed visitors. Seasoned county nurses not moving quickly enough for the epi. Clerks calling young mothers “stupid,” for bringing their febrile toddler in for the flu. Blood, on the floor, on the walls, on me. Graham crackers and saltines in all their whole-to-digested forms. Humanity, as it is. 

I think of these things, and I’m profoundly tired. Wellness carries no meaning to me right now. It’s an overspoken word, at this point. We complicate it, but the solution to fatigue is a cold beer and a nap, and we know it. Honestly, it’s hard to do much more than get up and go to work. Encounter the sadness. Feel the exhaustion. Carry on, my friends.

For many of us, this is where the thought ends. It is so. so. hard, to move on from that. The exhaustion. 

But this is the resilience. It’s recognizing all of these things. The humanity. And then seeing the parts that balance the scales. The “this is beautiful, kind of.” 

I have seen family sing to their loved ones. I have seen husbands ask us to stop, a love that supersedes the need to have a heartbeat. I have seen families hold vigil over a grandmother who hadn’t been able to talk to them for years. A mother hand me a sick baby and then squeeze my arm. Keep her safe. I have seen social work kneel next to a bed and ask, are you safe? Over and over and over. Are you safe, really? 

Kindness. I have seen kindness and gentleness and smiles and humor. I have been struck by how beautiful it is to give our homeless patients a sandwich. Are you safe? Yesterday, I asked for the first time in my career; do you have reliable access to clean water? And I watched the outrage in staff when the answer was no. The beauty in seeing a full glass of water every time I walked by the hallway bed. 

The psychotic patient accusing me of taking her heart. Believing I would take the small part left and she would die. Tears. Real tears, all for her heart. I’m not safe, doctor. The department’s custodian saying, you’re safe, love. Really.

I learned my hospital has a “no one dies alone” program available 24/7, where a volunteer will sit with a dying soul and gently tell stories till they take their last breaths. A hand to hold. Whispers at the door. This is beautiful, kind of. 

I am tired. 

But I recently saw a post here about “what drives you nuts in the ED.” And I saw all my colleagues call out our patients for coming to us for minor complaints. Primary care. Medication refills. The codes that wouldn’t end. This post took all I have. If my co residents and attendings and nurses and techs can’t muster up the energy to see the beauty we have in the raw humanity of the ER, how can I? 

Then this morning, my 88yo patient who sat all night for me to swab her for the flu told me that I had dimples that touched the bottom of my glasses when I smiled.

F**k it all. Carry on, my friends.

NorEpi as first-line for Cardiogenic shock,bab8ls,"I'm sorry for my poor understanding. I understand that since NE has modest beta effect and primarily effects alpha receptors with greater potency, it effects SVR and does not have so much net effect on CO. So if we have AMI causing cardiogenic shock or a situation where force of contraction is already poor, why would NE still be recommended as first line for those type of cardiogenic shock? In those situation, wouldnt one rather prefer something with decreased afterload/SVR AND increased contracility force?

Anyone have a good guide for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy?,b9mqnp,"Pt story 28f, nspmh g6p2 13 weeks pregnant, grossly thyrotoxic based on clinical picture (external throat pain followed by 1 wk fine tremors/wt loss/proptotic eyes/palpitations/sob/sinus tachy), confirmed by labs done by outside provider and repeated by us. Hr 115s/bp 120s/70s.

Uptodate focuses more on long-term management - I'm curious what your short term treatment principles are. I ask because beta blockers and steroids are both complicated in early pregnancy (if she was 24wks I wouldn't hesitate with either). The mature answer may be ""dead mother equals dead baby"" and to just treat thyrotox aggressively and let someone else wean her off meds.

Mental health history issues in a career as an EP?,b4j9fn,"Hopeful EM physician here -- please forgive naivety, I'm a post-college premed who's deciding to go back to med school after some time working.

When I was 21, I had some symptoms of depression/anxiety (with some unhealthy coping mechanisms) and proactively started seeing a therapist weekly.  Psychotherapy was hugely effective.  I matured a ton and kicked my bad habits, and feel ready to tackle a highly emotionally demanding career.  I was unfamiliar to the world of medical billing though, and learned a few months into treatment that my therapist was using billing codes for mild anxiety & depression and mild alcohol use disorder that now appear on my medical records and insurance history.

Most states seem to only ask about mental health/substance use diagnoses and treatment within the past 5-7 years, so I'm not too worried about licensure when that time comes, but some states I might want to end up in (ex. CA) do ask for full mental health/substance abuse history.  And pretty much every malpractice insurance application asks for history of treatment for alcoholism.

Does anyone have any opinions on what issues this might cause for me in terms of obtaining licensure or malpractice insurance (or at what other points in my career it might come up)?  And is stuff on those forms confidential?  If I were denied licensure/insurance, would the public/my patients/my employer be able to find out why?  Anyone have experience with diagnosed mental health conditions in medicine, or knows anyone who does and might be able to shed some light?

Brought a bad respiratory patient in last night, and the doctor pressed pretty hard whether the patient is normally A&Ox4. We all knew what he was getting at, and my issue isn’t with him, I know him and he’s tremendous. 

My problem is, in my experience, I believe “A&Ox4?” is a poor quality assessment tool and a clunky way to communicate. Is there really any clinical significance to a respo patient who knows time but not event? Does the difference between A&Ox3 and A&Ox2 really matter, other than that the patient is acutely altered from baseline? (Which is what we believed was the root question, and what we reported.)

We pick up from nursing homes. Dialysis clinics. Urgent cares. Family practice offices. Peds. Geriatrics. Mentally impaired. Etc.

Some people ask who’s the president, some avoid that question. Some ask the patient their full name. Some ask them to repeat our names. Etc ad nauseum.

Acute hypothermia (my first experience!),b487yu,"Very peculiar case I had yesterday. On initial presentation, I had a 90 Y/O F found supine at the base of the stairs in her basement. Now her healthcare aides had last seen yesterday around 20:00 and it was now 12:00 the following day so it was possible she fell at some point between the evening before and the current midday. She was lethargic, had sluggish speech, responded inappropriately to questions, and was generally confused. During physical exam I did note her extremities were cold and that her body was very rigid.

&#x200B;

I should've realized something was strange that she was wrapped in personal blankets and what looked like half clothed or in the process of being clothed. Apparently the healthcare aides found in her a puddle of water (they only figured to mention this like right as we were leaving). With much difficulty, I placed a collar on her and extricated her up a flight of stairs and into the living room. Pt had a hearing issue and a single hearing aid in the R ear. Still though she wasn't even telling me person or place or if she had any pain. She just kept responding sluggishly ""okay great"", ""whatever you say"", or ""alright sounds good"".

&#x200B;

At this point I considered her mentation may have been due to dementia, her hearing issue, she hit her head from falling down the stairs (she winced in pain when I palpated the back of her head), or hypoglycemia from be in the basement for so long. My vitals were BP 190/90, HR 106, RR 22, BGL 120, Pupils PERRLx2, negative stroke scale. We gathered her meds to create a list, no blood thinners. So we're on the way to the ED and I have the heat on and have wrapped her snugly in blankets because I usually assume elderly pts are baseline cold. Then miraculously during transit her mentation improves. I'm stupefied as she told me her name, knew the ED she was going to, and roughly recalled going to the basement in the morning to put away snow shoes before falling. She stated that it was because it snowed recently which wasn't entirely true, it snowed like weeks ago. My partner was like ""wow what did you do?"" I'm sitting there like ""I have no idea, she just became very lucid all of a sudden"".

&#x200B;

At the ED they took a temp (because we don't carry thermometers) with much difficulty and she was 93.6F. I had never seen the effects of hypothermia before, she was in the lethargic non-shivering state and was most likely much lower than 93.6F initially. It looks like healthcare aides found her in a puddle of water that was in the basement from outside drainage and moved her from the puddle to the base of the stairs. They then dried her and attempted to clothe her.",2019-03-23 07:29:28
Shifts per month listed in residency programs,b3ztea,"Hey guys, sorry if this has been addressed, I couldn't find what I was looking for by searching.

&#x200B;

I've spent a good deal of time on the EMRA residency map and noticed a section listing the duration of an EM resident shift and ""**Shifts Per Month"",** this is where I get confused, some will say 16-18 shifts per month, lasting X number of hours (usually somewhere between 9 and 12).

So what does this mean you guys are doing the rest of the month? The days there are no shifts? I read somewhere on SDN that the days there are no shifts there's other duties or work to be done, so you're always kept busy.... What would those be exactly?

This is difficult for me to understand because where I'm an intern (in Mexico, we are interns in 6th year of medical school, but have duties similar to what you guys do in PGY-1 but on 2 month core rotations), the EM residents are on q3 or q4 (depending on the program) 36 hour call and attend their regular shifts Monday thru Friday from 7am to 4pm...",2019-03-22 16:29:11

Efficiency/Workflow Suggestions?,b3wlu2,"All,

I'm wondering if anyone has any efficiency suggestions? I'm in a moderate-sized community ER. Our previous site lead put together the following list, wondering if anyone has any other great ideas or references?

Thanks!

&#x200B;

•	Sign up for your patients. 

o	Sign up right before you see the patient.  If you don’t there is very little to cue you that the patient belongs to you. This leads to docs forgetting to review / reassess and even leaving the dept. without signing over the patient. 

•	Try to never have no more than 6 active patients on the go at once. Studies have shown that efficiency in ER Docs drops with every patient over 6.

o	 Inactive patients like 2nd trops and waiting for an admitting doc (and not requiring much care from you) would not count in this. 

•	Never sign up for more than one patient. There are so many reasons for this:

o	Too many patients as above

o	Your colleague can see this patient next and move them out of the dept. sooner than you could of; 

o	You might be delayed by requests from nurses, phone calls etc. 

o	You may sign up for them but not actually see them and forget about them, delaying care

o	You can physically only see one patient at a time.

•	See the patient first then look up what you need on the EMR - There may be times that it makes sense to go to EMR first, but next to reassessing, this is the biggest speed booster in the ED. 

•	Involve Social Work &/or discharge planning early

•	Road test early. You don’t need all your tests back to do a road test. 

•	Carry DI reqs, Rx Pad, and work Absentee forms in pocket.

•	If all you need is an x-ray hand the patient the req. and tell them how to get to DI.

•	If you are d/c’ing a patient and there is no further nursing required, hand the Rx ( &/or work note) and send them off.

•	Consider pulling out their iv putting a 4x4 on it and some tape, having them hold it for a while and then leave. This might speed up turnover, however does require d/c ing them from EDIS and clicking the “clean bed” button.

•	Every time you come back to the computer check for new /updated labs (and usually new DI) then click “reviewed”. By doing so you will know that nothing new is back unless “new” or “updated” appears next to your patient’s name. 

•	Once all your patient’s tests are back make a decision. Do they need another test, admission or d/c? With the exception of waiting for their IM epi to wear off or their steroids to kick in, a period of observation rarely helps with a disposition decision. 

•	If you are going to an isolated area (ie fast track) to see a new patient, reassess or d/c a patient who is back there when you are on your way (not on your way back as you will forget or be distracted).

Cold Feet After Matching: Switching Specialties,b3h12l,"I'm a US-IMG that recently matched into anesthesia. I'm going to spare everyone the sentimental regretfulness that usually comes with these types of posts. I'm grateful to have matched in a mid-tier program that rarely takes IMGs and is US-MD heavy with very well connected faculty. With that said, I can't help but feeling like I made a mistake in choosing a specialty. I've always been drawn to EM but was fearful of being non-competitive among other reasons, so I decided to pursue anesthesia. Looking back, I think I would have made a good candidate for some mid-low tier EM programs that I would not have minded.  


I'm going to go into my PGY1 year with an open mind and work my tail off, but I'm seriously considering reapplying in the next application cycle. The only issue is the time constraint: I'd have to do an EM block, be transparent with my PD and redo the process all over again.   


Assuming all goes well (PD approval, EM letters and good performance), would applying as a PGY1 put me at a disadvantage?  Let me preface this by saying that I understand all of the competitive pitfalls that come with being an IMG.",2019-03-21 10:02:03

But nonetheless it just bothers me to a point that if someone is vomiting I cant be in the same foot distance as them. I myself start to feel queasy and shaky. Its an issue for me because I dont want it to be an issue ! I love being in the medical field and im learning so much by being where I work. I think the part that gets me the most is the sound itself. Seeing it doesn't bother me as much , the smell is not such a bother either , its just the initial sound is a lot for me to handle.

We’re looking for questions about symptoms, treatments and day-to-day life that, if addressed and fully answered by research, could make a real difference to people affected by sudden cardiac arrest. Examples of unanswered questions from other health conditions have included:

• Can we develop a vaccine to pre-vent prostate cancer?

• How can stroke survivors and their families be helped to cope with a speech problem?

&#x200B;

We will use the results of this survey to guide future research and inform our wider work as a research network. By sharing what we find with the international cardiac arrest research community, we hope to shape research into the condition not just in the Canada but all over the world.

Getting an Excellent SLOE on EM Sub-I's?,aw0hcz," 

Hi, I’m a rising 4th year US med student planning to apply into EM. I’ve finished 3rd year clerkships and just taken Step 1 so I'm starting to think about my upcoming EM rotations. Unfortunately, I finished 3rd year rotations with a lot of frustration around the clerkship evaluation process where I saw little correlation between my efforts and grades. My medical knowledge wasn't tops in the class, but it was certainly above average. And I really don't think getting along with people or not being a ""team player"" were issues either. Instead I think that because I'm a bit of an introvert who can be quiet, especially in new situations, I didn't always ""show off"" what I knew as well as some classmates. Because of all this it's hard not to be just a bit anxious about the SLOE process which is such a major part of the residency application. Does anyone have any thoughts or tips on how to really excel and get a top 10% SLOE, particularly in a big county ED with a top residency program? 

 

Obviously you have to get along with everyone and know your shit (which I plan to do using the EMRA guide, reading, and podcasts). But else can you do to set yourself apart? Thanks! ",2019-03-01 17:51:26

EKG advice,arhaak,"Edit: patient did end up with a stent and no signs of heart failure. 

Hey everyone, I work as an ER tech (just recently accepted into med school for the fall) and today I had a confusing occasion in which a late 20's male came in for high blood sugar. While helping out and checking in the patient, I overheard EMS say that he also complains of ""waves"" of chest pain however the ER nurse and physician did not really address this complaint as an EKG was not ordered. Once on the cardiac leads his rhythm looked suspicious as I noticed elevation and I asked the attending about possibly wanting an EKG in which he said, ""no, I am not concerned about this being cardiac related"". Well a few hours go by and the inpatient physician that took over placed an EKG and troponin order. The trop came back positive and when doing the EKG I noticed elevation in his inferior lead  with j point occurring in lead II. The inpatient physician could not be immediately reached so I showed another ER attending and pointed at my concerns in which he paged cardiology and started the STEMI process. 

Where I am concerned is that by this time, the patient was already worked up, and had been laying as an ED hold patient for 5 hours with the same rhythm as when he arrived. As this being the emergency medicine sub thread, how would you want someone to explain that concerns that would gain your attention? I tried to speak up and was told it was nothing but sitting here after shift I am feeling very bad for not advocating more for the patient as he sat for 5 hours before this elevation was addressed. Anyways, thanks for your time and any feedback I may get! ",2019-02-17 18:23:55

Questions to ask for potential jobs/insight for the job hunt?,ao9x87,"Hello everyone,

Apologies if this is not the correct sub (please point me the right way), but I'm an EM resident in a US program, and I'm starting to look for jobs. I'm looking for some guidance as far as what to look for when comparing one job to another, and maybe some questions to ask of medical directors and recruiters when I speak to them. At this point, I don't exactly know what data to collect to be able to compare jobs. If I'm missing any big/important questions, please educate me. Similarly if there are any questions that are pretty dumb, I'd like to know that too (and why)!

So far, this is my list:

* Group-specific questions:
   * Type of group? (private/democratic vs corporate vs hospital employee vs..other?)
   * How does partnership work? ie 5-years to become partner, vs 3 years to be considered for partner track, do you get voting rights right away or have to be a full partner?
   * Benefits? Medical/Dental/Vision/Malpractice Insurance?
   * Are all shifts at one hospital or more than one site? 
   * How many shifts per month are expected or available (is there a hard time getting shifts?), and what proportion of those shifts are at each site?
      * As a side note, is it better to work at a place where available shifts are snatched up quickly or it takes a few days?
* Hospital-specific questions:
   * What patient population primarily?
   * Length of shifts?
   * Trauma center? (Higher levels are going to receive more transfers & lower levels will transfer more)
   * STEMI/Stroke center? 
   * How many patients expected to see per hour (I'm hearing 2.4 is roughly average?)
   * OB on-call? (One attending told me they'd never work anywhere that didn't have 24/7 OB coverage. I suppose for malpractice?)
   * How much single coverage vs dual/multiple coverage?
   * Is the type of equipment in your resus/trauma bays important? (Ie if you have super old ultrasounds or no video laryngoscope or something)
* Financial Questions:
   * Hourly Rate?
   * Night Differential?
   * Bonus structure/how is surplus distributed?

Any insight you guys have for me regarding this process and things to watch out for or things to look for, would be very much appreciated. As an example, I've heard that if you do Locums and like a particular place, the hospital has to buy out your contract with Locums, which might be more expensive than hiring someone else, and so you may be overlooked for that spot because Locums has to get their finder's fee. Don't know if this is true, however. ",2019-02-08 12:39:16

Holding back tears for the last hour of my shift..,ama3pn,"On mobile so sorry if formatting is weird.

TLDR: when patients/families are nice, it feels good

As a tech in the ER, a lot of times I feel like I only do the things everyone else doesn’t want to do. I never really feel like people think what I do is an important part of their visit because it’s the background work. But man today I had such a beautiful moment with a patient and I wanted to share.   

So an older man and his family come in because he’s retaining a lot of fluid. I helped work him up, got a bladder scan, and just talked to him about what I do and where I wanted to go with my life.  When we decide he’s gonna be admitted, the doctor asked me to put in a foley. His family steps out and he jokes around with me and tells me that I was very professional and he appreciated it.   

There was some portable tele monitor issues, so I got to talk to his son some more. I found out we went to the same high school, which is common where I work, and he asked if I was in school and just generally seemed interested in what was going on.   

We finally were able to get upstairs, and I got him in his new bed, made sure he was comfortable, etc. And as I turned to say goodbye the son said thank you with the biggest smile on his face and shook my hand. He said good luck with your future plans and have a nice night. I don’t if it was because as a young woman I don’t get many handshakes at work or because as a tech I don’t get many genuine thank you’s or if it’s because I’m almost done with my shift, but I have never felt more respected for what I do ever. Literally holding back tears so I don’t look like a baby at the nurses station lol.

Current 3rd year deciding on EM vs Gen Surg,alhuem,"I'm a 3rd year struggling to decide between EM vs General surgery (trauma subspecialty). 

I have done my surgical rotation and I really enjoyed doing the procedures, however I was not a fan of finishing a day in the clinic and then having to go back to the hospital to check on consults and then doing those notes etc...
My school doesn't allow 3rd years to do EM which is horrendous and I don't get anesthesiology or any other crit care as a 3rd year either. 
 
I need to do things with my hands. I loved throwing in sutures, putting in central lines, cauterizing through muscles and cutting bones. It was phenomenal. And I want to do those things to acutely sick patients. 

Lifestyle does matter to me though, and I've read several places that say ""if you are already thinking about lifestyle then don't go into surgery.""

So that's the general gist of where I am at mentally in regards to what I am looking for in a career. What concerns me is if I go into EM because of lifestyle* and find myself wishing I was doing more in depth procedures. Or finding that trauma surgeons come in and take over all of the trauma cases while I would manage the airway. 

Side concern - I'm not really the gunner super competitive type. I have a drive to be a good doctor, but not to the stereotypical sense that surgeons do.

I'm 19 and have been working as an EMT for the last several moths. I originally wanted to go into structure firefighting, but have become very interested in emergency medicine. I've recently learned what a PA is and am intrigued by it. I like that it's less schooling than an MD and that there is the option to change specialties if you want. 

I'm currently looking into taking a CNA course so that I can be certed as both an EMT/CNA to try and get a position as an ER tech, hopefully sometime next fall. I figured that if I work as a tech, I'd be able to get a lot of clinical hours and EM experience while doing prereqs for a PA program.

Is working as an ER tech something that would be beneficial prior to a PA program? It seems like a dumb question now that I've typed it out, but still wondering.

Possible residency switch! Need some serious advice and help!,ahkygx,"Hi r/Emergencymedicine!
I need some serious help here, i'm down to the wire. I've been incredibly stressed for months over this.

I am currently an IM PGY-1 in a program that was my top choice in my hometown. I have family, friends here and great support. I love the hospital however I've realized I don't really enjoy IM or want to be a hospitalist. I love EM and am passionate about EMS. I was afraid to apply EM due to being afraid of not matching, which I now regret.

My institution has an EM program here. Side note: I've worked EMS for my hospital prior to medical school, volunteered in EMS in town, did an EMS/EM elective here and know many of the EM residents from being in the IM program. I approached the EM PD back in October of last year as well as my IM PD stating my interest in applying EM. The IM PD immediately stated that it was ok to apply, however I would no longer have an IM spot. I ultimately decided not to apply IM with the risk of being out of a residency program, and I told my IM program so.

Fast forward to now. The EM program just contacted me stating they requested a resident compliment back when I first expressed interest (adding another resident to the next class) in hopes to offer me a transfer position and got it approved by the ACGME! However they unfortunately are not allowed to offer it to me outside of the Match. Meaning I would have to now apply to just their program and enter into the Match this year for the added spot to the incoming class.

I need some advice. I want to go for it but I am absolutely terrified or the risk! Of being out of a residency and now pissing off my PD and my program because I am now changing my mind again when I told them back in November i'd be staying. The thought of being out of a residency is just...awful. Unsure I could find a PGY-2 spot. I also didn't perform as well as I could have for these first 6 months because I just felt depressed, not interested, and my IM program definitely noticed. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to get decent letters, etc. if I didn't Match.

Any advice? I meet with the EM program director this coming week.

Thanks guys. Much love.

What I'm looking at right now and what I intend to research runs along the lines of RN and PA; much as I'd like to do some looking into MD work, I just don't think that would be viable with the sheer amounts of student debt I'd be taking on to do so. At the moment I'm *kinda* leaning towards the RN track, but I'd like to do my research and hear what everyone else has to say first.

So, what's the advice here on r/emergencymedicine ? ",2019-01-19 09:39:06

Can I match EM,agtyt4,"I am hoping the awesome folks on this thread can offer some advice on whether this black mark on my application is too much to overcome to match in EM. I came into med school really interested in psych after working as a mental health crisis worker and am currently doing a June-June year long research project in psychopharmacology. However, this was set up before I did two psych rotations, both of which I hated. I did an emergency medicine rotation since it was available and it was the absolute best time in med school. Everything I loved about crisis work and medicine is present in the ER. However, there was a test at the end that I underestimated. My evaluations were great, but my score on the test excludes me from any grade but a “satisfactory.” My step one score was pretty average (233), and my clinical grades are otherwise good. My institution combats grade inflation aggressively. Basically my question is whether there’s any way I can make up for this and get a decent residency. My psych evals are awesome, but I’d rather be at an average EM residency than doing psych at Harvard. Any guidance y’all can offer will be much appreciated, I’m feeling like I screwed up my career and I’m not sure it’s salvageable.",2019-01-17 17:46:15

EM —> CC path. Pros? Cons? Did the training leave you feeling prepared?,aga9g0,"My school does not offer advising, and those who have offered to advise during interviews would be violating NRMP rules, hence my turning to the internet!

I’m an M4 interested in a career that includes time in both the ED and ICU (SICU or MICU).

During various points on the interview trail I’ve been told EM is either the best or the worst idea for working in CC and that IM/EM is either a great idea or a waste of time. Notably, the IM part makes pulm-crit an option. Getting a fellowship sounds do-able from either side, but I’ve heard mixed things regarding a) ability to get a CC job and b) getting a job that allows practice in both settings.

I had the chance to talk with one EM program director and he told me they were looking for US clinical experience in their applicants and never had any IMG/FMG for the past 5 years. (after this I checked programs IMG percentiles from [EMRA](https://webapps.emra.org/utils/spa/match#/search/map) and about 90 programs have at least 1 IMG in their program)

M3 Strongly Considering Applying EM. Why should/Shouldn't I?,ae4129,"I am like 99% sure I want to apply into EM, yet I know that as an M3 I probably have a very skewed view of what it is actually like, and instead have an idealized version in my head. I did work in an ED as a tech for a couple of years prior to medical school, so I have a bit of an idea, but still. Earlier on, I was planning on doing a surgical subspecialty, but I just keep going back to how much I loved being in the ED as a tech, and think I would enjoy the job more as an EM physician vs. any other specialty. 

About Me-

**Things I like that I think I would get a lot of in EM**- 
undifferentiated patients/investigative work, high-acuity, a fast-paced environment, working on a team, knowing a lot about a lot, dark humor, trauma, talking with patients, providing reassurance, fixing a problem, I am a night owl

**Things I don't like that I think would be well avoided by doing EM**- 
dispo planning to rehab/SNF, super long rounds, OBGYN Residents, being a 'technician' on a patient that has already been worked up, 

**My interests/things that may not be super compatible with EM**- 
Basic science research, neuroscience, I *like* the OR- but I don't absolutely love it (maybe I would miss it though), trauma surgery taking the cool trauma cases might be annoying

Are my interests well aligned with EM, in your opinion? Any other options I should look into based on the sparse data I provided?

What is your practice pattern for RSI in a post-ictal patient? What is your rationale for doing so?,acbbg8,"Third year EM resident here. It seems that most attendings prefer not to RSI post-ictal patients who are maintaining a patent airway, despite GCS 3, on the presumption of a quick neurologic recovery. This doesn't sit well with me because while their airway is ""patent,"" I do not believe they have the ability to protect their airway in an emesis/aspiration situation. My approach is to wait 5-10 minutes, and if there is not some type of neurologic recovery on exam, I move towards RSI. I can't seem to find any literature on the topic, so any expert opinions, clinical trials, or personal experience is appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks to those that provided helpful feedback. To be clear, I do not intubate ALL post-ictal patients, just those that don't seem to be making some type of neurologic recovery, in which there is concern for non-convulsive status or other unidentified cause of secondary seizure. Before posting this, I tried looking through Rosen's, and Tintinalli's, and I was not able to find specific direction on the issue.

Residency Rank List: New Program vs Established Program,ab5iok,"Greetings,

I've just finished up interviewing for EM residency positions and am facing a dilemma regarding which program to rank first.  I have interviewed at 12 programs, most of which are established and well regarded, for example, Cook County, Indiana, Emory, Brown, etc.  

I rotated at one of these established programs and loved it. I could literally go on for hours about how great this place is.  I honored the rotation with top 10% ranking, so they liked me too. 

I've also interviewed at Greenville Health System, a new program that has yet to graduate a residency class.  I was very impressed during my interview day. I think Greenville Health System has an excellent program, despite its newness, which may actually be a strength from a culture standpoint while being a weakness from a job placement standpoint. Greenville is basically home for me *and* my wife has a ton of extended family there that she visited every year growing up. It would be awesome to be close to our family. We plan to have kids soon, so being near family would be helpful as well.

Ultimately, I prefer to practice in the southeast, and Greenville would certainly be a desirable location for that.  I am leaning towards community emergency medicine. 

What are the repercussions for choosing a new program in a great location, near family over a well-established program that I know is a good fit?  Does reputation matter enough for community jobs to steer this decision?

Any input is greatly appreciated!

"MS3 EM Advice? Scheduling Audition Rotations, etc.",a14316,"Hello all,

First, I really want to thank you for this forum. I am a US allopathic medical student who is interested in going to EM. At this current time, I am figuring out all of the logistics of setting up my away rotations. I have spoken to my home institution EM faculty but they haven't been extremely helpful. I've also read around at various sites for information, but I am hoping to get insight from individuals who have done this recently.

I have my home EM rotation scheduled for early portion of my fourth year. I am hoping to do 2 away rotations in California, my home state. I am limited by a low Step1, right above 210, which has profoundly influenced my decision making. My 3rd year grades have all been high pass. I am debating whether it would be strategically more valuable to complete rotations at community institutions in less-than-ideal geographic locations in California where I might *actually* have a shot at interviewing and matching, oppose to pursuing larger academic institutions. The latter would be a ""Go big or go home"" sort of mentality. But I would like to be in these larger cities at select institutions because I have family nearby. I am hoping to solicit some advice:

&#x200B;

My questions:

\- When I apply for audition rotations to academic institutions (eg, UCSD, UCLA, UCSF Fresno, Stanford, etc)... will they reject my request due to my Step 1 score? I understand the process of securing an away is quite competitive.

\- What are your thoughts about where I should apply for audition rotations (other than apply broadly, hope for the best, and take any rotation offered)? Should I apply to smaller community programs or actually aim for the big academic ones that I am more interested in matching at? I likely only have a chance to do 2 rotations and I really want to make the most of these opportunities, but i'm not sure how to be strategic about it.

\- When is the ideal time to apply to complete my away? (I've research that I should start applying as soon as VSAS open) But would May, June and July be the right timeframe that other institutions begin to accept visiting students? I've reached out to a few of these institutions for clarification and have only heard crickets.

&#x200B;

Many thanks for all of your help!!

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm tracking with regards to Step 2. I do recognize that I have to knock it out of the park and I've started to prepare along third year. It's reassuring to hear that some programs will overlook my Step 1 if I can do well on Step 2.

EM being taken over by NPs and PAs.,9w8eje,"I’m a first year medical student who is interested in EM. However, I’m worried by the trend of increased anatomy for mid-level providers. My cousin is a NP who recently got a job staffing an ED independently of a doctor after just 2 months of graduating. She has a “supervising” physician who she can video call in when things hit the fan, but that’s all the supervision that is required in her state.  It worries me to think that someone who just graduated and was trained a little over a year more than I have been is responsible for the lives of people independently of a doctor. I’m honestly discouraged that once I’m done with residency my only job will be to stand by when things hit the fan and hope that no one dies.

EM training in Australia/Nz as an IMG?,9w62gx,"Heya guys

I'm currently undergoing my residency in internal medicine in Switzerland and should be board certified in IM in about two years from now (5 years PG-training in total). Depending on my rotations during the next two years, I will have at least 8  months of experience in EM. I might consider doing more during residency or add 1-2 more years after residency to earn a ""diploma in EM"". That certificate is the only advanced degree in EM that is available in this country (there is no board for EM and no recognized specialty in EM). EM is often still handled here by GPs, hospitalists and surgeons.
  
I'm interested in either working in NZ or Australia in the future, and in EM ideally so. As far as I can tell from studying online materials, it should be fairly easy for me to work in NZ without having to take any further exams. Working in Oz would require me to sit the AMC exam or to rely on the 'specialist' pathway and have my IM board certification recognised.  
  
**So here start my questions:**  
Does anybody know if EM training in these two countries can be done in less than five years if you already hold a specialty in internal medicine? Does foreign training in EM count towards those five years? Would a foreign diploma in EM be of any value in these countries?
  
Any help would be much appreciated ;)",2018-11-12 07:50:52

The Right Subreddit?,9tdvdq,"Hi there, ftp, not a medical professional but a patient who has been through quite a bit of medical trauma. I hope this formatting isn't terrible, but I apologize if it is. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Had many ER visits/hospitalisations for necrotizing pancreatitis and resulting complications. A bit of my story is below if you'd like to read, but mostly I'm looking for help to find a subreddit that offers information and support for patients with PTSD or histories of longer hospitalizations. 

&#x200B;

To give a very general summary of my situation, I am 22(f) and contracted necrotizing pancreatitis, caused by misdiagnosed acute pancreatitis. By the time I was hospitalized, I needed almost a complete pancreatectomy, and 95% of my pancreas was removed. 

About a month later, it was determined that I was stable enough to move to a long-term care facility. I was not, in fact, stable, but had a large hematoma, which was missed on my scans. I was transported to the facility before the hematoma was found,, and in just a few hours had started bleeding internally and had to be moved back to the hospital for emergency surgery. After the complications of that surgery, they weren't able to close my abdomen due to the swelling and other complications, so I was put into a medically induced coma. After that, they decided the best course of action would be to graft over the herniated area to let things heal before trying to repair my mess of an abdomen.

&#x200B;

The grafted-over hernia, while incredibly painful, kept me stable for a while until I was discharged, and I returned home and my family and at-home-nurses cared for me. It was sort of like having a pregnancy belly, but so much grosser. When I was digesting food, you could see my intestines moving through the graft. I once made someone throw up just by showing it to her, which I felt bad for (but also secretly evilly proud) I stayed at home for \~6 months with a few ER visits, and short hospital stays. I still had a surgical drain in on one side that kept rejecting no matter what we tried to do to keep it in. This had already been an issue in the long-term care facility, where I wasn't even allowed to leave bed without a nurse's assistance, yet the drains came out no less than 5 times. It only happened twice at home, but finally they decided that the abscess was small enough to safely resolve on its own and that was that with the drains.

&#x200B;

A month or two later I was admitted for bloody emesis, caused by varices coming from a clot in my spleen. Because of the instability of my abdomen, the risks for the typical methods of repair were too high. After weeks of deliberation, they decided to cauterize the main artery in my spleen to change the blood flow and fix the varices. (If this information sounds wrong, feel free to correct me. I'm typing this without the help of my charts and the mechanisms of this surgery were definitely over my head. I was also on a fair amount of Dilaudid.) After the surgery, I was back in business and determined to stay out of the ER.

 

Unfortunately, a few months later I was hospitalized again, this time for a bowel obstruction. (I was actually hospitalized for 3 previous bowel obstructions in the first few months I had been released from long term care, but they didn't require surgical intervention) These obstructions were being caused by surgical scarring in my intestines, and after so many recurrences, and with the severity of the last obstruction, they determined that I needed surgery. A small amount of my bowel was resected and I was left with a 6 inch scar that ran vertically over the left side of my graft. Of course, the story couldn't just end there!

 

The stitches split open, and had to be redone (twice) because the graft was so fragile. Then the graft started getting infected. Long story short, the bottom half of the graft became necrotic, decayed until the skin was sloughing off, and then it finally split, and I was eviscerated. (I'm glad that I've always been fascinated by the medical field, because while it was terrifying to see my own intestines, it was also very, very cool.)

&#x200B;

Given the now emergent situation, they decided to do a reparative abdominal wall surgery instead of attempting to fix the graft. This was already a surgery that had been planned, but we were intending on waiting several months until I had healed more from my last hospitalization. I don't know quite as much about the details of this surgery, as my anxiety surrounding the whole thing has kept me from talking/asking about it much, but essentially, they rearranged things a little and then  pulled my fascia, which had been cut down the middle of my abdomen, back to the center. The result was a large scar that ran from just under my sternum (xiphoid?) to bottom of my abdomen. (right above my pantyline, I've got no idea what the correct terminology would be here, lol) 

&#x200B;

Waking up with just a scar instead of a graft... Was surreal. Since then I haven't had any issues with obstructions, just the expected issues; pain, difficulty digesting, etc. and this is now the longest I've gone without being hospitalized for over a year. (Since the end of July!)

&#x200B;

I had a long journey to where I am, and still have a long way to go, but I'm forever grateful to the doctors and nurses who gave me a second chance. I wouldn't be here without them, and I'll never stop being grateful. 

&#x200B;

Despite their amazing work, all of this obviously took a pretty severe mental toll on me. I'm definitely open to answering anyone's questions if this gains any interest here, but mostly I hope to find a medical subreddit where I might also be able to post and discuss from the patient's point of view, and hear from people who have been through similar situations.

"Potential bad sloe (EM), should I upload it? what are my options",9nctv1,"Hey guys,
I am an MS4 applying for EM residency and I have been dreading about the bad sloe that is going to be uploaded any day now. I know it's not going to be a good sloe because a person who gave me negative evals said that I was not performing up to the institutions standards couple of times and I saw that sentiment being relayed on my mid-point feedback. Other than that my other 2 EM rotations went very well and the people in there treated me really well. I have average grades and slight above average (for EM) board scores. My dilemma is what should I do with potentially bad sloe???
Option A: Don't send it to other programs BUT I kinda need that SLOE to open up the northeast for me (I am not from northeast and I haven't gotten any interview invites from my northeastern apps). I also mentioned to one of my interviews that I did an away there, and the interviewer told me they would look out for that SLOE (facepalm)

Option B: Send it to my home institution and have them survey it for me. BUT that is not sitting well with me. Plus, I am actually interested in going to my home institution. So I don't want them to see a bad sloe and I also don't want them to get the impression that I play dirty as a professional.

Option C: call the program that is giving me a bad sloe and ask them to give me a feedback. Hell, I am not going to that program, even though I really wanted to go there initially. But I don't know how much of a help that is going to be and I don't want them to talk bad about me to other residencies.

Option D: watch the train-wreck catch on fire and submit the sloe only to have my future interviewers to ask me why I sucked at that away. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

halp, please

Update 1: Thank you very much for your responses, they helped so much. Considering none of my peers or advisers have given me straight answers. I got several interview invites from programs that I didn’t send my “potentially bad sloe”. I sent the sloe to 15 programs and they haven’t rejected me yet. So we shall see. I will update as things unfold.",2018-10-12 08:31:09

Falling in love with my EM rotation. Wondering how I should approach the next year.,9m84s4,"Long story short- I'm loving the ED.  The camaraderie, the on-the spot-detective work, diverse patient population, and rapid problem solving are really engaging to me.  For the first time, I don't want to leave the hospital when my shift is up.  My feedback from attendings and residents has been really positive too. 

I have a couple of issues: (1) I go to a DO school that doesn't offer much in terms of guidance when it comes to the match process.  How should I go about picking programs I want to audition for in 4th year?  What should I be looking for in an EM program?

(2) My step 1 score wasn't atrocious, but not that great either for an increasingly competitive field- a 225.  I was thinking about adding more research to my CV, but I'm not sure if I should completely invest in upping my step 2 score instead.

I only just wrapped up my first week so I would love to hear any advice about how I can continue to stand out. Thanks!",2018-10-08 09:20:40

4. if the wrist cuts are deep, after sucecibly restart the heart would stiches be done before or after blood transfusion?
5. would they need to talk to the police or a theraphist after the doctors prevent the suicide, if yes, how would the police/theraphist be notified? and by whom?
6. after discharge would they need any sorth of medicine? would the therapist if needed prescribe anything? if yes, what kind of pills/medicine?",2018-08-26 05:43:02

Here are a few imgur pics of the cards: [https://m.imgur.com/gallery/xU3Vd](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/xU3Vd)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello there!

I spent a ridiculous amount of time developing a template for some badass pharmacology review cards, but long story short I got way too busy with school and life and never finished the cards themselves. Anyways, rather than let them sit in the folder of unfinished dreams on my laptop, I would like to offer them to all of the medical subreddits for free. All I ask in return is that we turn this into a collaborative effort to create a living database of kickass drug cards for anyone in the field or classroom who wants a new tool to help them master the art and science of pharmacology. I have uploaded a current version of the template( including instructions on how to use it) into a google drive folder under an account I made for this, [freepharmcards@gmail.com](mailto:freepharmcards@gmail.com).

Some of you are undoubtedly more technically inclined than I am, and if anyone wants to take on the task of making a simple place for people to upload cards they complete and organize them into something useable that would be amazing. There is one technical challenge that remain unsolved which would streamline the process considerably: I still can't get the front and back of the slides to line up perfectly when printed on a double sided sheet of paper, so at the moment you have to print and cut the front and back separately and then stick them together, put them on an index card, laminate them front to back, etc. It's a workable solution but it would be so much more efficient if anyone can figure out how to line them up right, which would allow you to print 4 cards per page and cut them in seconds with a professional paper cutter.

You can print out the completed cards however you want to. One thing I learned is that you can indeed hit up a print shop and have them make you a deck of cards with these on a nice waterproof,bloodproof, alcohol-fast and tear-proof paper for around $30ish if I remember correctly. Or you can print, glue, and laminate them yourself. Without further adieu, I present to you the completed greedo4president drug card template: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mg3IDZfYRRfJQkBRZc\_8rwBv2dW9FYq0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mg3IDZfYRRfJQkBRZc_8rwBv2dW9FYq0)

Go forth and do great things.

Bachelor's in Emergency Health --> Pre-med,937s9e,"Hey yall, I hope this is the right place to post this, I already tried r/premed and was amazed at how unhelpful it was. 
 
So a little back story, I'm a paramedic, who works for a very progressive 911 service. I have my associates in Emergency Medical Services, and I was wondering if anyone here has completed UT Health Science's Bachelor's in Emergency Health and if they would recommend it, precisely as a bachelor's for Pre-Med. ( I understand it doesn't meet any of the pre-med requirements and  I would have to go back and still do a lot of Chem and physics) 

 http://www.uthscsa.edu/academics/health-professions/programs/bachelor-emergency-health-sciences

Pros: 
 Its an accredited state school, so nothing shady.
It's the study of something I  know I excel at and enjoy learning about ( and will help my current pts.)  
Because it gives me credit for my associates it would save me at least a year of school ( probably two), and quite a bit of $$. 
Its online so I can keep my day job ( my EMS service has a School schedule thank goodness) 

Cons: I'd still have to go back and finish my traditional Pre-med pre-requests. 
I'm already a non-traditional candidate to Medical school, and I'm worried this compounds that. 

The other option is I could get a regular old bachelor's degree in Biology from my local university, but it would be adding to what is already a long time commitment, and cost much more. 

What do yall think?

Rural EM Loan Forgiveness Programs,90zojj,"Hi,

My state offers primary care loan forgiveness to providers who return to work in rural areas doing OB, Fam, Psych, Peds but doesn't allow EM. I understand why they do this, however many rural hospitals then pay a pretty penny to have locums coverage. Do you know of any programs that allow debt forgiveness for EM?

EM intern worried about burnout,9003qd,"Currently I'm an intern in EM. I love the field, I'm obviously not fully comfortable in the ED working up patients, but I'm enjoying learning and I see my senior residents and attendings as good models of what to be in the future.

However, I worry about burnout.

I hear this especially from the older attendings, who talk about how hard life can be when they're missing Event X or Y's Birthday or how they can't switch from nights to days like they used to.

My question is: what are things to do post-residency to help mitigate the burnout? 

1. What are fellowship options that help mitigate burnout. I've read stuff about palliative and sports med giving docs a more ""normal"" gig to fall back on as they age. What about Tox? EMS? Administrative?

2. How easy or difficult is it to work 2-3 times a week as one ages? Are these jobs hard to come by and competitive to get? Do these jobs pay disproportionately less than if one works 13-15 shifts a month?

3. What does ""leadership"" entail and are these jobs less stressful for people? Do they provide a good break from the shift work that can be a blessing and a curse? How easy or difficult are these jobs to attain?

I want to emphasize that I do love EM, I do think it's the field for me, and I do try my best to stay healthy while working hard. However I don't want to be that doc that's chronically fatigued.

How common is group same specialty disability when getting a full time job?,8zzzbk,"It is offered as a benefit from my present job - and I was currently looking at a guardian disability policy. However, it limits how much they can give me due to my existing group coverage. 

Is it fairly standard for a full time job Non-IC in EM to offer same specialty disability? 

Im trying to decide whether I should I pay for a not inexpensive rider to possibly double my coverage in the future? If get a new job that doesn't have disability, and I take the rider I assume that my premium will increase (ie: double) in a linear fashion with increased coverage, I may not even take it as it is already very expensive.  If disability is a fairly standard benefit, I may just forgo this rider. (im not looking at income replacement, merely as sufficient income to maintain a middle class lifestyle for my family if i couldn't work)

Can you still get pain meds in the ER if you really need them??,8zqv7x,"Hello, non medical person here.  [I stumbled ac cross an article the other day](https://reason.com/archives/2018/06/01/how-the-government-made-the-opioid-crisi/1) which, given the political slant, I took with a grain (or many grains) of salt, read only if you really want to.   Point being say I am up on my roof doing repairs and fall off breaking my leg and/or hip.  When I get to the ER will my pain be treated or has it gotten to the point where giving opioids is pretty much for only the most severe cases?  Also, is the risk of addiction taken into account when prescribing narcotic pain meds?  What about long term pain management, like say for physical therapy and rehab?   I myself have relatively little experience with pain meds, I played a lot of sports when I was younger so broke many bones but don't remember anything about the strength, type, or duration of any narcotic pain meds.  I had a root canal a few years ago, was given a script for oxycodone, it made my so sick to my stomach the dentist switched me to hydrocodone (I think), anyways it was only for a few days.

"Extremely vulgar, nasty, inappropriate nurse. . . what to do?",8ymmh0,"So looking for some opinions/advice on how to handle this personality. I'll be starting new in an ER where I've spent some time before during residency. How do I deal with an inappropriate nurse w/o turning her and everyone else in the ED who likes her against me?

One of the nurses there has a very loud personality. She is constantly making vulgar, inappropriate sexual jokes. Just to give an example of what I'm talking about- Once she joked about (WARNING THE FOLLOWING IS VULGAR/ADULT/RATED R)

 ""a patient who was coding, she had to straddle him while she was doing compression. When she was done she notice the patient had an erection and she notice she was also wet. Hahaha."" Just to give an example by what I mean of vulgar and I promise this is almost verbatim what she said but probably with more vulgar language. She does this constantly the whole shift while she's there. Very loud. The rest of the ED staff seems on the surface to be okay with her, when she makes a big scene they laugh, joke along with her etc. She has been there a while and doesn't seem to have toned down, I'm guessing no one else complains. She makes me slightly uncomfortable as a couple of time when I was in the ER she contacted me physically etc. . .

	 I understand the ER personalities are usually a bit feisty with slightly inappropriate humor and I have no problem with that, I find it enjoyable. But I'm wondering how I deal with this lady, being the newbie in the ER, not turning everyone against me because I called her out, or making things award between me and this nasty nurse because we will have to work together. She is very intense and sometimes likes to pick me out probably because I don't really respond like everyone else does and I'm new. 

Thanks for any tips, opinions, advice, insights.

Does anyone here also work in any sort of Primary Care?,8y96jj,"I'm a current M2, heavily learning toward emergency medicine, but to be honest I do really like the idea of establishing long term relationships with patients too. I used to work in an ER with a doc who did about 8 shifts a month in the ER and then had what was basically a concierge practice as well. He said he absolutely loved it because he got to practice medicine the way he wanted to (and make a fuck ton of money selling hormone replacements I'm sure) and then also spend time in the ER essentially giving away free healthcare to more disadvantaged populations.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has done anything like this, or if this particular doctor just got really lucky and that life isn't really feasible anymore.
